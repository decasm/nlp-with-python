But \u201cFarewell\u201d (that was the French intelligence service code name for the Soviet leaker) has something you don't see very often: an endorsement blurb from Ronald Reagan himself, who called this real-life affair \u201cone of the most important espionage cases of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nTo reveal much about the plot would be giving away classified information, but (For Your Eyes Only \u2014 Burn After Reading) it begins in 1981 and involves the efforts of Sergei Gregoriev (played by the extraordinary Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica, who directed the Cannes Film Festival winners \u201cWhen Father Was Away on Business\u201d and \u201cUnderground\u201d) to undermine his country's failed communist system for personal as well as patriotic reasons. \u201cTo survive, this country must change,\u201d he insists. He's secretly hoping to bring about a better life for his typically sullen teenage son Igor, who's obsessed with cassettes of \u201cdecadent Western music\u201d like Queen and David Bowie, and is as disillusioned with Brezhnev as he is with his dad.\n\nGregoriev enlists the reluctant Pierre Froment (played by Guillaume Canet, director of the exceptional thriller \u201cTell No One\u201d), a French businessman living with his family in Moscow, to smuggle high-level intelligence out of the country. After all, as a complete amateur, he is such an unlikely spy that he is virtually above suspicion. \u201cFarewell\u201d weaves together the story of their largely improvised covert operation, the emotional effects of the secrets these men keep from their wives and families, and the political implications of their revelations at the highest levels of government \u2014 in France, the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nYou'll notice that the two main characters are played by film directors, and director Carion has a good time playing in the territories where the movies and life intersect, whether it's President Reagan (Fred Ward) obsessing over the shift in perspective (from James Stewart to John Wayne) at the end of John Ford's \u201cThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\u201d or Gregoriev watching 8mm family home movies projected into the corner of the ceiling, so that they appear as if on the inside of a cube.\n\nThat's another thing about Carion's direction: He has an eye for unusual, atmospheric touches \u2014 the kinds of striking little things you notice in the world and think: \u201cSomebody should put that in a movie\u201d \u2014 like the way light filters through trees (from the sun or a helicopter spotlight), a face illuminated for a split second in the back seat of a parked car at night, or a kite spotted by a man who's driving with his head out the side window. \n\nThere's a brief scene in which Igor (Evgenie Kharlanov), listening to Queen's \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d on his new Sony Walkman, stands on a picnic table surrounded by an crowd of ferns and imagines himself as Freddie Mercury onstage. It has little to do with the movie's plot, but witnessing this private moment you instinctively realize that it, as much as anything, signals the inevitable fall of the Soviet system.", "running_time": 113, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 2010, "date_published": "2010-07-28", "genres": ["Action", "Foreign", "Thriller"], "title": "Farewell (2010)"}
