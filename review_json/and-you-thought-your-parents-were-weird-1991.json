The movie tells the story of two brothers, Josh and Max (Joshua Miller and Edan Gross), who win the local science fair by inventing a robotic garbage can, and then outdo themselves by creating a robot named Newman.\n\nThere is enough plot here for six movies, as Newman\u2019s memory chips are invaded by the spirit of the boy\u2019s dead father, a computer genius. The kids have always thought their father committed suicide, but he turns out to have been the victim of a nefarious plot - all of which he explains in the voice of Alan Thicke.\n\nMeanwhile, the kids are up against their archenemy, the obnoxious Dwayne Kotzwinkle, who usually wins the science fair, and whose fa ther, Walter, runs the local used computer store, even though he looks as if he would be more at home as an extra in \u201cDeliverance.\u201d And Josh and Max have a cute mother (Marcia Strassman, from \u201cHoney, I Shrunk the Kids\u201d), who is engaged to a magazine writer. And I almost overlooked the subplot involving the nosy TV anchorwoman, and the other one involving the electronics tycoons.\n\n\u201cAnd You Thought Your Parents Were Weird\u201d seems inspired by several different sources. The talking computer is from \u201c2001\u201d by way of \u201cLook Who\u2019s Talking.\u201d The bright kids are from \u201cReal Genius\u201d by way of \u201cWeird Science.\u201d The clever, precocious robot is from \u201cShort Circuit.\u201d The high school rivalry is from every other high school movie ever made, and when the boys\u2019 mom has to choose between her boyfriend and the ghost of her dead husband, it\u2019s hard not to think about \u201cChances Are.\u201d Is the movie worth seeing on its own? Only marginally; it\u2019s the kind of entertainment that seems like more fun on Nickelodeon than when you paid for your ticket. Joshua Miller is an interesting hero - intense, earnest and thoroughly adolescent - and A.J. Langer brings a certain bounce to his tomboy girlfriend. But the plot is needlessly labyrinthine - there\u2019s a limit to how many schemes we can keep straight at a time. And the physical stunts seem forced and unlikely. The strangest thing about it is that the parents in the movie are less weird than just about everybody else.", "running_time": 92, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1991, "date_published": "1991-11-15", "genres": ["Family"], "title": "And You Thought Your Parents Were Weird (1991)"}
