I will tell you how I arrived at this diagnosis. Genevieve has an unbreakable policy regarding men: Five dates, and she\u2019s out the door. She even specifies exactly what each of the dates must be like, leading up to No. 5, during which she doesn\u2019t say so, but going all the way is a possibility.\n\nWhy does she impose these draconian measures? Because she likes only the falling in love part of an affair, and not the inevitable breaking up. She expects a guy to jump through the hoops and then disappear after No. 5, remaining of course a friend. When a woman says, We should stay friends, it translates as: Take your genitals to a far-away place and limit our contact to sending me flowers on my birthday.\n\nLet\u2019s assume conservatively that Genevieve started dating when she was 20, and that she has met on average three men a year willing to accept her strictures. And that after completing all the requirements, half of them have triumphantly arrived at home plate. Given her age, which a gentlemen does not mention, that works out to 39 sex partners. According to surveys reported by ABC News and the New York Times, which I don\u2019t necessarily believe, the average American woman has between four and seven sex partners in a lifetime. That means Genevieve is not only an obsessive-compulsive, but a nympho.\n\nYet she looks so sweet. And knows she does. Yes, this is the second movie in close to a month, after \u201cMy Life in Ruins,\u201d in which Nia Vardalos goes through the entire film smiling brightly and almost continuously. Nobody smiles that much unless they suffer from the rare giocondaphobia, or Constantly Smiling Syndrome, a complaint more often seen among viewers of Rush Limbaugh and field hands in \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d\n\nGenevieve is a woman beloved by all who encounter her, when in real life, I would be terrified of her. She is considered a source of great wisdom about romance, although Dr. Phil might advise protective custody. In \u201cI Hate Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d she runs the cutest little florist shop in Brooklyn and dispenses invaluable advice to men uncertain about a Valentine\u2019s Day gift (flowers). She has two gay assistants who think she is about the best thing since Maria Callas. And this cute guy opens a tapas bar next door, named Get on Tapas, haha.\n\nThe cute guy is played by John Corbett, her co-star in \u201cMy Big Fat Greek Wedding.\u201d He is way too desirable to have to settle for the Five-Date Rule. The women from \u201cSex and the City\u201d would be camped out in pup tents on his sidewalk. It should have occurred to someone, maybe Vardalos, the writer and director, that it would have been funnier and way more plausible to make the hero a needy schlub who is lovestruck and would agree to waterboarding for even one date. The movie is set up as a valentine to Vardalos. She should try sending herself flowers.", "running_time": 98, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 2009, "date_published": "2009-07-01", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "title": "I Hate Valentine's Day (2009)"}
