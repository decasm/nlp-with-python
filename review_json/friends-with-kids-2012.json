Don\u2019t you think? \u201cFriends With Kids\u201d is altogether too casual about parenthood, and that supplies a shaky foundation to a plot that\u2019s less about human nature and more about clever dialogue. As a light entertainment, it has its pleasures, but at the end I was left with feeling sorry for the poor kid who emerges as such a great convenience.\n\nWe meet three couples who live comfortably in New York City and Brooklyn. They apparently chart their progress through life by comparing themselves to one another. That\u2019s possible in the sealed universe of a movie, although in life, most couples have more than four friends, and there\u2019s a certain turnover rate.\n\nNot here. Jason and Julie (Adam Scott and Jennifer Westfeldt) are very best friends who live in the same apartment building. They date around and don\u2019t have romantic feelings for each other \u2014 something they keep repeating lest we forget. They form what their friends treat as a virtual couple: They\u2019re not married, they\u2019re not sleeping together, and yet at a dinner party, you routinely invite them together.\n\nBen and Missy (Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig) are married, and were once in such deep lust, it was a standing joke in their circle. As passion has worn off, they are gradually suspecting there was never much else, and friends who once basked in the glow of their love now shiver in the chill of their sniping.\n\nLeslie and Alex (Maya Rudolph and Chris O\u2019Dowd), the Brooklynites, are closer to normal, comfortable with each other and announce \u201cwe\u2019re pregnant!\u201d That\u2019s one of the final straws for Jason and Julie, who are both increasingly fretful that they\u2019re childless. They\u2019re aware their clocks are ticking and decide to have a baby with each other and sidestep the whole marriage and divorce routine. They\u2019ll date other people, split the baby-sitting and child care 50/50, and everybody will be happy, right?\n\nRather soon after they have this ideal child, they do indeed start dating other people: Jason meets Mary Jane (Megan Fox), and Julie is literally pushed into the arms of Kurt (Edward Burns), who is such an improbably nice man, he borders on parody. I always wonder exactly what \u201cdating other people\u201d means. Is it assumed it won\u2019t affect the ideal platonic friendship Jason and Julie began with? If they fall in love with those \u201cother people,\u201d how do those ideal people handle the notion of each contributing 25 percent of the baby-sitting and child care (and presumably costs) of the kid in the middle of all of this? How is this explained? How would you feel if you started seeing someone and he/she explained, \u201cI love you enough to marry you and share with you a child I had with my best friend, who is still very much in my life and who we will be seeing every day and always have to live near\u201d?\n\nMy guess is, it wouldn\u2019t go over. The old-fashioned marriage and divorce routine has a lot to be said for it. \u201cFriends With Kids\u201d isn\u2019t constructed as simply a comedy and intends to have a measure of sincerity and even truth at its heart. But it smells off. It feels like an artificial screenplay concoction that\u2019s perhaps pitched at moviegoers 15 or 20 years younger than the stars \u2014 audiences who don\u2019t have the experience to understand the whole child-sharing scheme is cockamamie.\n\nYes, and we all know where the plot is headed, anyway, because if there\u2019s one thing we know about a rom-com, it\u2019s that conventional values invariably must win in the end. It\u2019s almost painful to watch characters jump through the obligatory story hoops in the third act. Even presumably real people don\u2019t behave like this.", "running_time": 107, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 2012, "date_published": "2012-03-07", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "title": "Friends with Kids (2012)"}
