A prankish romantic comedy in the early going, it turned into a mean thriller \u2013 a combination that, however bril\u00adliantly handled, proved to be commercially damaging.\n\nWith \u201cMarried to the Mob,\u201d Demme enacts his own theme about second chances by bringing a less threatening attitude to bear on the same basic story. The results are very good \u2013 far better and funnier than most of what is being made these days. But having worked through similar material, Demme suffers a dropping-off of urgency here. Cute and ingratiating, \u201cMob\u201d too often comes to rest on something mild.\n\nThe gangly hero this time is FBI agent Mike Downey (Matthew Modine), a gung ho young fellow who comes off like a stoned Boy Scout in keeping surveillance on mob wife Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer, modeling luxurious brunette curls). Actually, she\u2019s now a widow: Her hit-man husband, \u201cCucumber\u201d Frank De Marco (Alec Baldwin), was just murdered by his boss, Tony \u201cThe Tiger\u201d Russo (Dean Stockwell), for fooling around, with the same floozy.\n\nCreepy Tony, a flashy Al Capone-style dresser who considers himself God\u2019s gift to women, wants Angela in the worst way. It will take a while before Mike sees that she wants out in the worst way \u2013 out of Tony\u2019s sight, out of the \u201cfamily,\u201d out of a life in which everything she eats or wears \u201cfell off a truck.\u201d\n\nShot in Demme\u2019s patented dreamy/wide-\u00adawake style (his cameraman, for the sev\u00adenth time, is the gifted Tak Fujimoto), \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d brings an absurdist sit-com effervescence to its domestic scenes. Angela\u2019s 7-year-old son, Joey (Anthony J. Nici), makes his old man proud by sucker\u00ading his little suburban pals in three-card Monte. When Angela tearfully demands a divorce, Frank laughs his head off, so crazy is the notion in line-toeing family circles.\n\nDemonstrating their own bent syndicate moxie, a gang of mob wives converges on Angela in the supermarket, wielding lethal carts. Mrs. Tony \u201cThe Tiger\u201d Russo (Mercedes Ruehl) is the film\u2019s wild card: a psychotically jealous wife who will go to any length \u2013 and does \u2013 to make sure no one else is squeezing her husband.\n\nAttempting to start a new life, Angela gives away all of her tainted belongings and moves with Joey from her house on Long Island into an awful dive on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. After a series of hum\u00adiliating job interviews, including one with the drooling Mr. Chicken Lickin\u2019, she goes to work at a hair salon run by a goodheart\u00aded Jamaican named Rita (reggae singer \u201cSister\u201d Carol East, one of the joys of \u201cSomething Wild\u201d).\n\nFew directors thrive on the ethnic riches of city life, or the tackiness of American culture, as personably as Demme. Shot for the most part in actual locations, \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d imparts a gritty vitality and generosity. But no amount of atmosphere or far-reaching ambiance from soundtrack maestro David Byrne \u2013 who programs ev\u00aderything from Rosemary Clooney\u2019s \u201cMambo Italiano\u201d to Wazmo\u2019s \u201cKramtorn Avenges the Puttbundles\u201d \u2013 can overshadow the lack of romantic chemistry between Modine and Pfeiffer.\n\nMaybe this is rapture speaking \u2013 with her perfect cheekbones, lips and almond-shaped blue eyes, Pfeiffer could be the most beautiful movie actress alive \u2013 but there\u2019s no way the stylish Angela would fall at first sight for the weird, geeky Mike. Even if he is good at explaining dinosaurs to her kid.\n\n(He\u2019s also good at convincing Angela how \u201cit\u2019s not easy to turn your life around when the past keeps coming back to haunt you,\u201d an unnecessary statement of theme that reflects Demme\u2019s determination to make sure everyone gets this film.)\n\nEven those who do get the point may not get Modine\u2019s strange performance. Hanging every word on an expression of exaggerated false sincerity, he comes off like a cartoon character looking for his frame. Even in the wordless romantic postscript following the end credits, in which Mike and Angela are seen happily out on the town, we still don\u2019t know quite what to make of him.\n\nIn her best performance to date, Pfeiffer is delightful in a more straightforward way. But this couple falls considerably short of Melanie Griffith and Jeff Daniels in \u201cSomething Wild.\u201d And as the menacing third party, Stockwell, however solid, isn\u2019t funny or threatening enough to give the story the proper spin. The climax, in which everyone converges on Miami Beach, never takes off.\n\nStill, \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d is loaded with wonderful offbeat touches, ranging from tough guy (and Demme regular) Charles Napier\u2019s appearance as a done-up hairdresser to the scene in which Mike spontaneously joins a street-corner vocal quartet in order to remain undercover. Whatever it lacks, \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d most assuredly doesn\u2019t lack soul.", "running_time": 103, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-08-19", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Crime", "Romance", "Thriller"], "title": "Married to the Mob (1988)"}
