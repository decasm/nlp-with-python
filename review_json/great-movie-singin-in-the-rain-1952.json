Its originality is all the\r\nmore startling if you reflect that only one of its songs was written new for\r\nthe film, that the producers plundered MGM's storage vaults for sets and props,\r\nand that the movie was originally ranked below \"An American in Paris,\u201d\r\nwhich won a best picture Oscar. The verdict of the years knows better than\r\nOscar: \"Singin' in the Rain\u201d is a transcendent experience, and no one who\r\nloves movies can afford to miss it.\n\nThe\r\nfilm is above all lighthearted and happy. The three stars--Gene Kelly, Donald\r\nO'Connor and 19-year-old Debbie Reynolds--must have rehearsed endlessly for\r\ntheir dance numbers, which involve alarming acrobatics, but in performance\r\nthey're giddy with joy. Kelly's soaking-wet \"Singin' in the Rain\u201d dance\r\nnumber is \"the single most memorable dance number on film,\u201d Peter Wollen\r\nwrote in a British Film Institute monograph. I'd call it a tie with Donald\r\nO'Connor's breathtaking \"Make 'em Laugh\u201d number, in which he manhandles\r\nhimself like a cartoon character.\n\nKelly\r\nand O'Connor were established stars when the film was made in 1952. Debbie\r\nReynolds was a newcomer with five previous smaller roles, and this was her big\r\nbreak. She has to keep up with two veteran hoofers, and does; note the\r\ndetermination on her pert little face as she takes giant strides when they all\r\nmarch toward a couch in the \"Good Morning\u201d number.\n\n\"Singin'\r\nin the Rain\u201d pulses with life; in a movie about making movies, you can sense\r\nthe joy they had making this one. It was co-directed by Stanley Donen, then\r\nonly 28, and Kelly, who supervised the choreography. Donen got an honorary\r\nOscar in 1998, and stole the show by singing \"Cheek to Cheek\u201d while\r\ndancing with his statuette. He started in movies at 17, in 1941, as an\r\nassistant to Kelly, and they collaborated on \"On the Town\u201d (1949) when he\r\nwas only 25. His other credits include \"Funny Face\u201d and \"Seven Brides\r\nfor Seven Brothers.\u201d\n\nOne\r\nof this movie's pleasures is that it's really about something. Of course it's\r\nabout romance, as most musicals are, but it's also about the film industry in a\r\nperiod of dangerous transition. The movie simplifies the changeover from\r\nsilents to talkies, but doesn't falsify it. Yes, cameras were housed in soundproof\r\nbooths, and microphones were hidden almost in plain view. And, yes, preview\r\naudiences did laugh when they first heard the voices of some famous stars;\r\nGarbo Talks!\u201d the ads promised, but her co-star, John Gilbert, would have been\r\nbetter off keeping his mouth shut. The movie opens and closes at sneak\r\npreviews, has sequences on sound stages and in dubbing studios, and kids the\r\nway the studios manufactured romances between their stars.\n\nWhen\r\nproducer Arthur Freed and writers Betty Comdon and Adolph Green were assigned\r\nto the project at MGM, their instructions were to recycle a group of songs the\r\nstudio already owned, most of them written by Freed himself, with Nacio Herb\r\nBrown. Comdon and Green noted that the songs came from the period when silent\r\nfilms were giving way to sound, and they decided to make a musical about the\r\nbirth of the talkies. That led to the character of Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen),\r\nthe blond bombshell with the voice like fingernails on a blackboard.\n\nHagen\r\nin fact had a perfectly acceptable voice, which everyone in Hollywood knew;\r\nmaybe that helped her win an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.\r\n(\"Singin' \u201c was also nominated for its score, but won neither Oscar--a\r\nslow start for a film that placed 10th on the American Film Institute list of\r\n100 great films, and was voted the fourth greatest film of all time in the\r\nSight & Sound poll.) She plays a caricatured dumb blond, who believes she's\r\nin love with her leading man, Don Lockwood (Kelly), because she read it in a\r\nfan magazine. She gets some of the funniest lines (\"What do they think I\r\nam? Dumb or something? Why, I make more money than Calvin Coolidge put\r\ntogether!\u201d).\n\nKelly\r\nand O'Connor had dancing styles that were more robust and acrobatic than the\r\ngrandmaster, Fred Astaire. O'Connor's \"Make 'em Laugh\u201d number remains one\r\nof the most amazing dance sequences ever filmed -- a lot of it in longer takes.\r\nHe wrestles with a dummy, runs up walls and does backflips, tosses his body\r\naround like a rag doll, turns cartwheels on the floor, runs into a brick wall\r\nand a lumber plank, and crashes through a backdrop.\n\nKelly\r\nwas the mastermind behind the final form of the \"Singin' in the Rain\u201d\r\nnumber, according to Wollen's study. The original screenplay placed it later in\r\nthe film and assigned it to all three stars (who can be seen singing it\r\ntogether under the opening titles). Kelly snagged it for a solo and moved it up\r\nto the point right after he and young Kathy Selden (Reynolds) realize they're\r\nfalling in love. That explains the dance: He doesn't mind getting wet, because\r\nhe's besotted with romance. Kelly liked to design dances that grew out of the\r\nprops and locations at hand. He dances with the umbrella, swings from a\r\nlamppost, has one foot on the curb and the other in the gutter, and in the scene's\r\nhigh point, simply jumps up and down in a rain puddle.\n\nOther\r\ndance numbers also use real props. Kelly and O'Connor, taking elocution lessons\r\nfrom a voice teacher, do \"Moses Supposes\u201d while balancing on tabletops and\r\nchairs (it was the only song written specifically for the movie). \"Good\r\nMorning\u201d uses the kitchen and living areas of Lockwood's house (ironically, a\r\nset built for a John Gilbert movie). Early in the film, Kelly climbs a trolley\r\nand leaps into Kathy's convertible. Outtakes of the leap show Kelly missing the\r\ncar on one attempt and landing in the street.\n\nThe\r\nstory line is suspended at the two-thirds mark for the movie's set piece,\r\n\"Broadway Ballet,\u201d an elaborate fantasy dance number starring Kelly and\r\nCyd Charisse. It's explained as a number Kelly is pitching to the studio, about\r\na gawky kid who arrives on Broadway with a big dream (\"Gotta Dance!\u201d), and\r\nclashes with a gangster's leggy girlfriend. MGM musicals liked to stop the show\r\nfor big production numbers, but it's possible to enjoy \"Broadway Ballet\u201d\r\nand still wonder if it's really needed; it stops the headlong energy dead in\r\nits tracks for something more formal and considered.\n\nThe\r\nclimax ingeniously uses strategies that the movie has already planted, to shoot\r\ndown the dim Lina and celebrate fresh-faced Kathy. After a preview audience\r\ncheers Lina's new film (her voice dubbed by Kathy), she's trapped into singing\r\nonstage. Kathy reluctantly agrees to sing into a backstage mike while Lina\r\nmouths the words, and then her two friends join the studio boss in raising the\r\ncurtain so the audience sees the trick. Kathy flees down the aisle--but then,\r\nin one of the great romantic moments in the movies, she's held in foreground\r\ncloseup while Lockwood, onstage, cries out, \"Ladies and gentlemen, stop\r\nthat girl! That girl running up the aisle! That's the girl whose voice you\r\nheard and loved tonight! She's the real star of the picture--Kathy Selden!\u201d\r\nIt's corny, but it's perfect.\n\nThe\r\nmagic of \"Singin' in the Rain\u201d lives on, but the Hollywood musical didn't\r\nlearn from its example. Instead of original, made-for-the-movies musicals like\r\nthis one (and \"An American in Paris,\u201d and \"The Band Wagon\u201d),\r\nHollywood started recycling pre-sold Broadway hits. That didn't work, because\r\nBroadway was aiming for an older audience (many of its hits were showcases for\r\nageless female legends). Most of the good modern musicals have drawn directly\r\nfrom new music, as \"A Hard Day's Night,\u201d \"Saturday Night Fever\u201d and\r\n\"Pink Floyd the Wall\u201d did. Meanwhile, \"Singin' in the Rain\u201d remains\r\none of the few movies to live up to its advertising. \"What a glorious\r\nfeeling!\u201d the posters said. It was the simple truth.", "running_time": 103, "mpaa_rating": "G", "release_year": 1952, "date_published": "1999-02-14", "genres": ["Comedy", "Music", "Romance"], "title": "Singin' in the Rain (1952)"}
