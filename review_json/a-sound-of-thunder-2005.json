But the movies have changed and so have I and today there is something almost endearing about the clunky special effects and clumsy construction of \u201cA Sound of Thunder.\u201d The movie is made with a gee-whiz spirit, and although I cannot endorse it I can appreciate it. There\u2019s a fundamental difference between movies that are bad because they\u2019re willfully stupid (\u201cDeuce Bigalow, European Gigolo\u201d) and movies that are bad because they want so much to be terrific that they explode under the strain.\n\n \u201cA Sound of Thunder\u201d may not be a success, but it loves its audience and wants us to have a great time. The movie is inspired by a famous short story by Ray Bradbury, arguing that to travel back in time and change even one tiny element in the past could completely alter the future. In that it is firmly Darwinian, and indeed if the common ancestor of all primates had died without reproducing, where would that leave us?\n\n In the movie, a greedy entrepreneur (Ben Kingsley) charges millionaires a small fortune to travel back in time, kill a giant prehistoric reptile, and return with a video of themselves. In theory this will not change the present because (a) frozen liquid nitrogen bullets are used, which will evaporate making no difference, (b) the targeted beast is selected because in another second it would have died anyway, and (c) the travelers never leave anything behind.\n\n Since the same scenario is played out time and again, it raises the question of why each hunting party doesn\u2019t run into the other ones. Subtle dialogue hints suggest that maybe even the \u201csafe\u201d visits are making small changes, but then something happens big time, and the \u201cpresent\u201d is socked with a series of \u201ctime waves,\u201d which look like an optical tsunami and leave a different world behind them.\n\n The film\u2019s hero is Travis (Edward Burns), a scientist who hopes to recreate ancient DNA. He leads the time expeditions. The heroine is Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack), who invented the computer that oversees the travel. The heart of the movie involves a series of desperate expeditions into the past to repair or prevent what went wrong, so that the familiar \u201cpresent\u201d will return. Meanwhile, in alternative realities, a futuristic Chicago becomes a tropical swamp inhabited by giant reptilian bats, saber-toothed eagles and lots and lots of bugs.\n\n Now about the special effects. The scene where the giant brontosaurus attacks the travelers looks so precisely like actors standing in front of back projection that it scarcely improves on the original \u201cKing Kong.\u201d In the first time-travel scene, as the travelers walk out of a wormhole and into a shimmering pathway, why do they all look in the same direction? Wouldn\u2019t some of them look the other way? Why does the thick rain forest not have any trees in front of a volcano, so we can see it clearly? How can a volcano so far away that we can see all of it and yet be so close that its lava arrives in seconds? How can the lava look like dirty shaving cream and not like molten rock? How come if the power is out all over the city, the time machine can work? How can\u2026\rBut what the hell, once you realize the effects are not even going to try to be convincing, you start to enjoy them. Perfect special effects can have a cold detachment to them; lousy ones can be eerie, strange, or fun. The future Chicago in this film, which makes the city in \u201cBatman Begins\u201d look like a documentary, is fantastical and preposterous; seeing the futuristic skyscrapers, the roadways in the sky, the airships and the cars that all move at exactly the same speed, I was reminded of the covers of old sci-fi pulp magazines. When Travis and Sonia are trapped in a flooded subway with giant eels and the tunnel is caving in, I found it wonderful that they eventually escape through the kind of manhole we see in \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d\n\n Some of the dialogue is worth repeating. When Sonia finds the computer incapacitated and says she needs another terminal, someone suggests \u201cHow about Home Depot?\u201d And consider this exchange:\n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n \u201cThe molecular structure of brontosaurus blood.\u201d\n\n \u201cNo Way! Cool!\u201d\n\n The movie was directed by Peter Hyams, who a lifetime ago was an anchor for Ch. 2 News in Chicago. He has directed mostly science fiction, including \u201c2010,\u201d \u201cCapricorn One,\u201d \u201cOutland,\u201d \u201cEnd of Days,\u201d \u201cStay Tuned,\u201d \u201cTimecop\u201d and \u201cThe Relic\u201d (1997), another movie in which creatures in flooded Chicago tunnels played an important role. \u201cA Sound of Thunder\u201d looks cobbled together from a half-baked screenplay and underdone special effects, but it\u2019s made with a certain heedless zeal that makes you smile if you\u2019re in tune with it.", "running_time": 110, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 2005, "date_published": "2005-09-01", "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Thriller"], "title": "A Sound of Thunder (2005)"}
