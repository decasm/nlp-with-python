It took place last April, at the U.S.A. Film Festival\r\nin Dallas, during a day devoted to new short films. They screened a 39-minute\r\nmovie named \u201cJunior High School,\u201d and the audience, myself included, was\r\ncompletely won over: How could we have anticipated such a completely winning,\r\nsunny and wickedly funny experience from a previously unsung film?\n\n\u201cJunior\r\nHigh School\u201d has played a dozen festivals since then. I included it on my\r\n\u201cburied treasures\u201d program last September at the Toronto Festival of Festivals,\r\nwhere it was a great success. savagery. It\u2019s an original musical about innocent\r\nteenage romance. It was shot on location at a real Southern California junior\r\nhigh school; it stars real junior high school kids playing versions of\r\nthemselves, and of course, it\u2019s populated with all the stock characters like a\r\nwacko shop teacher, the prim librarian, the gung-ho women\u2019s gym instructor, the\r\nknow-it-all class brain and the hero\u2019s best friend.\n\nThe\r\nstory behind the movie is sort of a cinematic rags to riches. Three film\r\nstudents, David Wechter, Michael Wankin and Steve Jacobsen, made a TV\r\ncommercial for theLos Angeles\r\nTimesas a personal project.\r\nIt turned out that theTimesliked it enough to buy it and run it,\r\nand with the money from that sale, they began the financing for \u201cJunior High\r\nSchool.\u201d (This movie, in turn, impressed the Walt Disney studios enough that\r\nWechter and Nankin were invited to direct a feature, \u201cThe All-Night Treasure\r\nHunt\u201d).\n\nThe\r\nmovie has the flash and sparkle of a \u201creal\u201d musical \u2013 production numbers, comic\r\nsongs alternating with serious numbers \u2013 and it has a plot with which we\r\nimmediately identify. This Friday\u2019s the night of a big dance, and the hero\u2019s in\r\nlove with a girl he\u2019s afraid to invite. Will he? Or will he be waylaid by the\r\nclass sexpot? Will the wiseacre know-it- all sabotage everyone\u2019s plans?\n\nThe\r\nmovie remembers the funny and the painful aspects of teenage sex life, in such\r\npoignant numbers as one sung in girls\u2019 gym: \u201cThe Itty Bitty Titty Committee.\u201d\r\nIt pulls out all the stops in a big production number involving P. E. classes.\r\nIt puts together one virtuoso number involving orchestra rehearsal, shop class,\r\nhome economics and study hall. And its climax is cleverly built around such\r\nrealities as corridor passes, messenger duty, the passing of notes and poetic\r\njustice. In summary: I think it\u2019s probably impossible not to be charmed out of\r\nyour socks by \u201cJunior High School.\u201d\n\n\r\n2007 Note: One of the stars is the then-unknown Paula Abdul.\n\n ", "running_time": 37, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1980, "date_published": "1980-01-11", "genres": null, "title": "Junior High School (1980)"}
