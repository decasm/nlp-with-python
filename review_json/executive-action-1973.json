{"url": "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/executive-action-1973", "by": "Burt Lancasteras Farrington", "star_rating": 2.0, "text": "When you walk out of \u201cExecutive Action,\u201d they give you an eight-page newspaper filled with photographs, charts, footnotes and cross-references to the Warren Report. It\u2019s designed to convince you that the movie\u2019s version of the Kennedy assassination could be true. Indeed it could. It could also be false. Nothing in the movie establishes one or the other. This is essentially a dramatized rewrite of all those old assassination conspiracy books; it borrows from actual newsreel footage of Kennedy, Oswald and Jack Ruby for most of its power.\n\nAnd it does have power, make no mistake. It has the power, of evoking what will probably remain, for most of us, the most stunning public moment of our lives: the moment when we first learned that the President had been shot.\n\nThe media have been filled with recollections for days now, and they\u2019ve been all the more melancholy because, as someone said the other day, it\u2019s beginning to look as if Nov. 22, 1963 was the day things started to go wrong for America. Whether they went wrong on purpose, because of a rightwing plot financed by a Southern millionaire (which is the thesis of \u201cExecutive Action\u201d), or whether they went wrong just because of the crazy accident of Lee Harvey Oswald, is something we\u2019ll likely never know. But there\u2019s something exploitative and unseemly in the way this movie takes the real blood and anguish and fits it neatly into a semi-documentary thriller.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case with Fred Zinnemann\u2019s movie about a plot against De Gaulle, \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d (which has finally made it to the Loop after months in the neighborhoods). We knew that was fiction from the beginning; it was well-paced, the characters were brilliantly drawn and we were entertained. But \u201cExecutive Action\u201d doesn\u2019t seem much to want to entertain. \n\nThe characters are deliberately played in extremely low key, and they talk as if they were reciting peculiarly stiff PR releases. (\u201cThe President is planning a motorcade to woo votes,\u201d Robert Ryan is actually forced to say at one point.) No, we\u2019re left with the notion that the men who made this movie really want to convince us of their conspiracy theory, \n\nThe story was coauthored by Mark (\u201cRush to Judgement\u201d) Lane, the screenplay is by old liberal Dalton Trumbo and the colorless direction is by David (\u201cLonely are the Brave\u201d) Miller. They don\u2019t seem to understand that showing something as it could have happened doesn\u2019t mean it did. The movie doesn\u2019t justify its ending, then. We\u2019re shown the faces of 18 \u201cmaterial witnesses\u201d who died, most of them violently, in the three years after Kennedy\u2019s death. We\u2019re told that an insurance actuary calculated that the odds against all 18 dying before February 1967, were 100,000 trillion to one. Fine. And I guess we\u2019re supposed to walk out of the theater convinced. But . . . not a single one of those 18 \u201cmaterial witnesses\u201d is ever shown in the film.", "running_time": 91, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-11-20", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama", "History", "Thriller"], "title": "Executive Action (1973)"}
