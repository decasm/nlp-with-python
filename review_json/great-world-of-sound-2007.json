To a very small degree. We actually even see one of the clients in the \u201cprofessional\u201d studio. But the real point is to get the hopefuls to show their \u201ccommitment\u201d by \u201cinvesting\u201d $3,000 in their \u201cfutures.\u201d We follow two of the Great World salesmen on their odyssey through the cheap motels and fast food grease pits of the South: Martin (Pat Healy), a neat, introverted, worrywart, and Clarence (Kene Holliday), an ebullient African-American who, after spending three years on the streets of Houston, is happy to have this job or any job.\n\nIn a way, the movie resembles Albert and David Maysles\u2019 great documentary \u201cSalesman\u201d (1968), about door-to-door Bible salesmen. The salesmen in both films are led to expect much larger rewards than are possible. But \u201cGreat World\u201d has another dimension: Although Martin and Clarence are fictional characters, many (but not all) of those who come to audition aren\u2019t in on the joke. They think it\u2019s a real audition: in that sense, they\u2019re as exploited in real life as in the story. (Director Craig Zobel says he got releases from everybody after the fact.)\n\nSome of the performers make you wonder how they deluded themselves that they had talent. But one, a young African-American girl, sings her \u201cNew National Anthem,\u201d which is so good I think it should be recorded for real. Oddly enough, Martin likes it too, and commits the con man\u2019s cardinal sin: investing in his own scam.\n\nThe movie resembles \u201cBoiler Room\u201d and \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d in how the recruiters of the salesmen tell expansive stories how about how successful they have become. It\u2019s a little heartbreaking, however, how moderate the \u201criches\u201d are that they promise their recruits. If they work hard and do good business, the salesmen are told, they can hope to clear $1,000 a month. Shank (John Baker), the head of the enterprise, adds a bit of stagecraft at one point, dialing his bank on a speaker phone and hearing his current balance read aloud. It was, as I recall, something like $13,000. Not millions.\n\nThe drama in the film arises as Martin has a crisis of conscience, while Clarence has a crisis of fear that he might be back on the streets soon. Watching them work the marks is fascinating, when one is dubious and the other desperate. \u201cGreat World of Sound,\u201d a Sundance hit, is Zobel\u2019s first film, a confident, sure-handed exercise focusing on the American Dream, turned nightmare.", "running_time": 106, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 2007, "date_published": "2007-10-25", "genres": ["Drama", "Indie"], "title": "Great World of Sound (2007)"}
