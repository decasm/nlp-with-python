Their great concern is finding the best place and way to raise their child, who is a bun still in the oven. For every character like this I\u2019ve seen in the last 12 months, I\u2019ve seen 20, maybe 30, mass murderers.\n\nSam Mendes\u2019 \u201cAway We Go\u201d is a film for nice people to see. Nice people also go to \u201cTerminator Salvation,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t make them any nicer. \u201cAway We Go\u201d opened last week in New York and Los Angeles, and now rolls out after lukewarm reviews accusing Verona and Burt of being smug, superior and condescending. These are not sins if you have something to be smug about and much reason to condescend.\n\nAre the supporting characters caricatures or simply a cross-section of the kinds of grotesques we usually meet in movies? I use the term grotesque as Sherwood Anderson does in Winesburg, Ohio: a person who has one characteristic exaggerated beyond all scale with the others.\n\nBurt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) live not far from his parents, in an underheated, shabby home with a cardboard-covered window. \u201cWe don\u2019t live like grown-ups,\u201d Verona observes. It\u2019s not that they can\u2019t afford a better home, as much that they are stalled in an impoverished student lifestyle. Now that they\u2019re about to become parents, they can\u2019t keep adult life on hold.\n\n\u201cAway We Go\u201d is about an unplanned odyssey they take around North America to visit friends and family, and essentially do some comparison shopping among lifestyles. Her parents are dead, so they begin with his: Gloria (Catherine O\u2019Hara) and Jerry (Jeff Daniels). The parents truly are self-absorbed, and have no wish to wait around to welcome their first grandchild. They\u2019re moving to Antwerp.\n\nVerona is of mixed race, and Gloria asks her conversationally, \u201cWill the baby be black?\u201d Is this insensitive? Why? Parents on both sides of an interracial couple would naturally wonder, and the film\u2019s ability to ask the question is not racist, but matter of fact in a America slowly growing tolerant. In moments like that, the married screenwriters, Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida (both novelists and magazine publishers), reflect a society in which race is no longer the primary defining characteristic.\n\nAfter the parents vote for Belgium, Burt and Verona head for Phoenix and a visit with her onetime boss Lily (Allison Janney) and her husband Lowell (Jim Gaffigan). Lily is a monster, a daytime alcoholic whose speech is grossly offensive, and her husband and children in shock. They flee to Madison, where Burt\u2019s childhood friend Ellen (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has changed her name to \u201cLN\u201d and become one of those rigid campus feminists who have banned human nature from their rule book.\n\nThen it\u2019s off to Montreal for friends from college, Tom and Munch (Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey), who are unhappily convinced they\u2019re happy. And next down to Miami and Burt\u2019s brother, whose wife has abandoned her family. There\u2019s not a single example of healthy parenting in the lot of them.\n\nThe almost perfect relationship of the unmarried Verona and Burt seems to survive inside a bubble of their own devising, and since they can blow that bubble anywhere, they of course find the perfect home for it, in a scene of uncommon sunniness. They have been described as implausibly ideal, but you know what? So are their authors, Eggers and Vida. They are thirtysomethings. With two children. Novelists and essayists. He publishes McSweeney\u2019s, she edits the Believer.\n\nThey are playful but also socially committed. Consider his wonderful project \u201c826 Valencia,\u201d a nonprofit storefront operation in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Boston and Ann Arbor, Mich. It runs free tutoring and writing workshops for young people from ages 6 to 18. The playful part can be seen in San Francisco, where the front of the ground floor is devoted to a Pirate Store. Yes. With eye patches, parrot\u2019s perches, beard dye, peg legs, planks for walking \u2014 all your needs.\n\nI submit that Eggers and Vida are admirable people. If their characters find they are superior to many people, well, maybe they are. \u201cThis movie does not like you,\u201d sniffs Tony Scott of the New York Times.
