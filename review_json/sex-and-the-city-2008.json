Perhaps you will enjoy a review from someone who disqualifies himself at the outset, doesn\u2019t much like most of the characters and is bored by their bubble-brained conversations. Here is a 145-minute movie containing one (1) line of truly witty dialogue: \u201cHer 40s is the last age at which a bride can be photographed without the unintended Diane Arbus subtext.\u201d\n\n That line might not reverberate with audience members who don\u2019t know who Diane Arbus was. But what about me, who doesn\u2019t reverberate with the names of designer labels? There\u2019s a montage of wedding dresses by world-famous designers. I was lucky I knew who Vivienne Westwood was, and that\u2019s because she used to be the girlfriend of the Sex Pistols\u2019 manager.\n\nThe movie of \u201cSex and the City\u201d continues the saga of the four heroines of the popular HBO series, which would occasionally cause me to pause in my channel surfing. They are older but no wiser, and all facing some kind of a romantic crossroads. New Line has begged critics not to reveal plot secrets, which is all right with me, because I would rather have fun with plot details. I guess I can safely say: Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is in the 10th year of her relationship with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) when they sort of decide to buy a penthouse they name \u201cHeaven on Fifth Avenue.\u201d Publicist Samantha (Kim Cattrall) has moved to Los Angeles, where her lover Smith (Jason Lewis) has become a daytime TV star. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and her husband, Harry (Evan Handler), have adopted a Chinese daughter. And Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is in a crisis with her husband, Steve (David Eigenberg).\n\nWhat with one thing and another, dramatic developments cause the four women to join one another at a luxurious Mexican resort, where two scenes take place that left me polishing my pencils to write this review. The girls go sunbathing in crotch-hugging swimsuits, and Miranda is ridiculed for the luxuriant growth of her pubic hair. How luxuriant? One of her pals describes it as \u201cThe National Forest,\u201d and there\u2019s a shot of the offending proliferation that popped the Smith Bros. right into my head.\n\nA little later, Charlotte develops a tragic case of turista, and has a noisy accident right there in her pants. This is a key moment, because Carrie has been so depressed she has wondered if she will ever laugh again. Her friends say that will happen when something really, really funny happens. When Charlotte overflows, Carrie and the others burst into helpless laughter. Something really, really funny has finally happened! How about you? Would you think that was really, really funny?\n\n\u201cSex and the City\u201d was famous for its frankness, and we expect similar frankness in the movie. We get it, but each \u201cfrank\u201d moment comes wrapped in its own package and seems to stand alone from the story. That includes (1) a side shot of a penis, (2) sex in positions other than the missionary, and (3) Samantha\u2019s dog, which is a compulsive masturbator. I would be reminded of the immortal canine punch line (\u201cbecause he can\u201d), but Samantha\u2019s dog is a female. \u201cShe\u2019s been fixed,\u201d says the pet lady, \u201cbut she has not lost the urge.\u201d\n\nSamantha can identify with that. The dog gets friendly with every pillow, stuffed animal and ottoman and towel, and here\u2019s the funny thing, it ravishes them male-doggy-style. I went to AskJeeves.com and typed in \u201cHow do female dogs masturbate?\u201d and did not get a satisfactory answer, although it would seem to be: \u201cJust like all dogs do, but not how male dogs also do.\u201d\n\nOn to Mr. Big, the wealthy tycoon and a victim of two unhappy marriages, who has been blissfully in love with Carrie the last few years. I will supply no progress report on their bliss.\n\nBut what about Mr. Big himself? As played by Chris Noth, he\u2019s so unreal, he verges on the surreal. He\u2019s handsome in the Rock Hudson and Victor Mature tradition, and has a low, preternaturally calm voice that delivers stock reassurances and banal cliches right on time. He\u2019s so ... passive. He stands there (or lies there) as if consciously posing as the Ideal Lover. But he\u2019s ... kinda slow. Square. Colorless. Notice how, when an old friend shouts rude things about him at an important dinner, he hardly seems to hear them, or to know he\u2019s having dinner.\n\nThe most human character is Louise (Jennifer Hudson), who is still in her 20s and hasn\u2019t learned to be a jaded consumerist caricature. She still believes in True Love, is hired as Carrie\u2019s assistant and pays her own salary on the first day by telling her about a NetFlix of designer labels (I guess after you wear the shoes, you send them back). Louise is warm and vulnerable and womanly, which does not describe any of the others.\n\nAll of this goes on for nearly two-and-a-half hours, through New Year\u2019s Eve, Valentine\u2019s Day and other Bonding Holidays. The movie needs a Thanksgiving bailout opportunity. But this is probably the exact \u201cSex and the City\u201d film that fans of the TV series are lusting for, and it may do $50 million on its opening weekend. I know some nurses who are going to smuggle flasks of Cosmopolitans into the theater on opening night, and have a Gal Party. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d one of them asked me. \u201cTwo flasks,\u201d I said.", "running_time": 145, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 2008, "date_published": "2008-05-29", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "title": "Sex and the City (2008)"}
