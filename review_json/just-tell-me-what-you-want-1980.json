It\u2019s a\r\nworld that\u2019s not new in the movies, but not often is it seen as sharply as in\r\nthis film, which, amazingly, leaves us feeling fairly affectionate about the\r\npeople involved: This is a film that could have just been high-class, soft-core\r\ntrash, but it sneaks in a couple of fascinating characters and makes them real.\n\nThey\r\nare Max Herschel (Alan King), investor, art collector, husband, lover,\r\novergrown baby, and Bones Burton (Ali MacGraw), his mistress, who\u2019s in\r\ntelevision production. She\u2019s also his prize creation; they met, we gather, 13\r\nyears ago when she was a teenager, and Max has educated her, stage-managed her\r\ncareer, doted on her ever since.\n\nBut\r\nnow there\u2019s a crisis: Max has purchased a near-bankrupt studio, and wants to\r\nplunder it for its film library and then sell the real estate to make a sports\r\nstadium. But Bones wants to try to turn the studio around.\n\nHe\r\ncan\u2019t quite see his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 succeeding on her own. But they have other\r\nproblems, too. Bones, who has just had another abortion and isn\u2019t getting any\r\nyounger, wants to get married. But Max is still married, and supports his\r\nderanged wife (Dina Merrill) in a series of expensive private institutions. He\r\nalso cheats on both his wife and his mistress.\n\nBones\r\ngrows rebellious, falls in love with a young playwright, and marries him one\r\nmorning. Max, enraged, tries to strip her of everything he\u2019s ever given her.\r\nBones, livid, violently attacks Max with her handbag in Bergdoff Goodman\u2019s, in\r\none of the movie\u2019s funniest scenes. And Max, wounded, goes undercover to try to\r\ndestroy Bones\u2019s husband.\n\nAll\r\nof the ins and outs of the plot (and they are many) are essentially just props\r\nfor the director, Sidney Lumet, who is mostly concerned with the characters of\r\nMax and Bones. The movie\u2019s especially successful with Max, who comes across as\r\nvirile, childish, bright, vindictive and perversely likable.\n\nThe\r\nperformance by King is surprisingly good, considering how little feature film\r\nacting experience King has; King really inhabits the role of the rich tyrant,\r\ninstead of just strutting through the dialogue. MacGraw is good, too, as Bones,\r\nmaking the character sexy primarily because of her intelligence.\n\nThe\r\nmovie has several good supporting performances, especially by Myrna Loy, as an\r\nexecutive secretary who sees right through all of Max\u2019s many moods, and by\r\nKeenan Wynn, as an ancient real estate tycoon who is Max\u2019s chief competition.\r\nThe whole cast, indeed, is plausible as real people, and that\u2019s what makes this\r\nmovie somewhat unusual.\n\nThere\u2019s\r\na whole genre of movies about the sex lives of the rich and famous, and the\r\nactors in them usually seem a little smaller than the lives they\u2019re playing.\r\nNot this time: \u201cJust Tell Me What You Want\u201d somehow succeeds in taking on a\r\ntacky genre, overcoming it, and giving us a couple of actually interesting\r\ncharacters.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1980, "date_published": "1980-02-12", "genres": null, "title": "Just Tell Me What You Want (1980)"}
