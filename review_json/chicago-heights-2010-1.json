Daniel Nearing demonstrates in \"Chicago Heights\" that's not necessarily true. The book is a collection of 22 short stories connected by the character George Willard, who comes of age there and reflects on the citizens he has grown to know. Perhaps one could make 22 short films. Nearing finds an approach that in 90 minutes accomplishes the uncanny feat of distilling the book's essence.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 2010, "date_published": "2010-12-08", "genres": null, "title": "Chicago Heights (2010)"}
