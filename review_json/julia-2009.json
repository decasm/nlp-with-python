She\u2019ll take on any role without her ego, paycheck, vanity or career path playing a part. All that matters, apparently, is whether the movie interests her, and whether she thinks she can do something interesting with the role. She almost always can. She hasn\u2019t often been more fascinating than in \u201cJulia,\u201d a nerve-wracking thriller with a twisty plot and startling realism.\n\nWe have not seen this Tilda before \u2014 but then, we haven\u2019t seen most of the Tildas before. This one is an alcoholic slut who lacks what we are pleased to call normal feminine emotions. She\u2019s just been fired from another job. Her pattern is to get sloppy drunk every night and drag a strange man to bed. She needs money. Her neighbor Elena (Kate del Castillo) comes to her with an offer. Her young son is now living with his millionaire grandfather, who won\u2019t allow her to see him. She needs somebody to help her kidnap the child.\n\nThis is the beginning of Julia\u2019s nightmare journey through a thorny thicket of people you do not want to meet. If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s consistent about her behavior, it\u2019s how she lies to all of them. This is not one of those tough heroines you sort of like. You don\u2019t like her. She makes not the slightest effort to be liked. She doesn\u2019t give a damn. She cuts back on the drinking, however, perhaps because she is constantly fleeing \u2014 both away from, and toward.\n\nYou have to give a lot of credit to Erick Zonca, the 53-year-old French director who co-wrote the film with Aude Py. He makes it move relentlessly. He skillfully buries it in seedy American and Mexican locations that never, ever, feel like sets. He uses a child actor and uses him well. He makes no attempt to sentimentalize the kid, who is spoiled and hostile. He puts Swinton at the center of this, and she plays Julia as a tough broad who is in way over her head, and desperately invents stories to mislead those who want the money involved \u2014 which starts out at $50,000 before she cheats her way up to $2 million.\n\nThe plot of \u201cJulia,\u201d with its twists and turns and surprises and rotten luck, is, shall we say, not very plausible. I believed it. That\u2019s because everything that happens seems inevitable, not contrived \u2014 the inescapable outcome of what has gone before, growing out of the greed and evil of the characters, which Julia, who is herself greedy and evil, is blindsided by. I could summarize the plot for you in one sentence, but I don\u2019t think I will, and when you see the film, you will understand why.\n\nDo we hate this woman Julia? When you see how she treats the boy Tom (Aidan Gould), we want to, except that she\u2019s all that stands between Tom and much worse things, including death. No matter what her motives for keeping him alive, there comes a moment when she shields him with her body from a man with a gun, and an utterly amoral woman would have made a deal.\n\nOh, she offers lots of deals. She\u2019s not to be trusted. There are times here when only her quick powers of invention keep her and the boy alive, and Swinton does a magnificent job with a tough acting challenge: letting us see how desperate she is without another character being able to tell. This movie lives on the edge all the way through, right up until an astonishing final scene on the median strip of a superhighway. What she does then shows that she\u2019s a better woman than she was when she started out, but you can\u2019t call it a false happy ending, because it\u2019s more wrung out than happy, and, after all, what choice did she have?\n\n\u201cJulia\u201d should have a big ad campaign and be making a lot of noise, stirring up word-of-mouth. It\u2019s being treated as an art film. It\u2019s good enough to be an art film, but don\u2019t let anyone pigeonhole it for you. It\u2019s one doozy of a great thriller. And the acting here is as good as it gets \u2014 not just from Swinton, but from Saul Rubinek as her one remaining friend, and by Bruno Bichir as Diego, who she meets in Tijuana. You want to be careful who you meet in Tijuana.\n\nSwinton here is amazing. She goes for broke and wins big time.", "running_time": 138, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 2009, "date_published": "2009-07-01", "genres": ["Drama", "Foreign"], "title": "Julia (2009)"}
