Here is a man who is paid to eavesdrop on a conversation in a public place. He succeeds, but then allows the tapes to be stolen. His triple-locked apartment is so insecure that the landlord is able to enter it and leave a birthday present. His mail is opened and read. He thinks his phone is unlisted, but both the landlord and a client have it. At a trade show, he allows his chief competitor to fool him with a mike hidden in a freebie ballpoint. His mistress tells him: \u201cOnce I saw you up by the staircase, hiding and watching for a whole hour.\u201d\n\nHarry, the subject of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Conversation\u201d (1974), is not only bad at his job, but also deeply unhappy about it. Once his snooping may have led to the deaths of a woman and child. Now he fears that his new tapes will lead to another murder. In the confessional, he warms up by telling the priest that he has taken the Lord\u2019s name in vain and stolen some newspapers from a rack. Then he says: \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in some work that I think will be used to hurt these two young people. It\u2019s happened to me before. People were hurt because of my work, and I\u2019m afraid it could happen again and I\u2019m . . . I was in no way responsible. I\u2019m not responsible. For these and all my sins of my past life, I am heartily sorry.\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s not responsible, why is he sorry? Harry, played by Gene Hackman in one of the key performances of a great career, tries to distance himself from his work. But even Meredith (Elizabeth MacRae), the hooker he brings home from a convention, can see how worried he is. \u201cForget it, Harry. It\u2019s only a trick--a job. You\u2019re not supposed to think anything about it. Just supposed to do it.\u201d She\u2019s talking for herself as well. When he wakes, it\u2019s to discover that she has taken her own advice and stolen the tapes.\n\nCoppola, who wrote and directed, considers this film his most personal project. He was working two years after the Watergate break-in, amid the ruins of the Vietnam effort, telling the story of a man who places too much reliance on high technology and has nightmares about his personal responsibility. Harry Caul is a microcosm of America at that time: not a bad man, trying to do his job, haunted by a guilty conscience, feeling tarnished by his work.\n\nThe movie works on that moral level, and also as a taut, intelligent thriller. It opens with a virtuoso telephoto shot, showing a San Francisco plaza filled with people. Faraway music mixes with electronic sounds. There is a slow zoom in to the back of Caul\u2019s head, and then the camera follows him. Other shots show a man with a shotgun microphone, on top of a nearby building, holding in his cross hairs a young couple (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest) who are the subject of the investigation. Eventually we go inside a van packed with electronic gear, where Stan (John Cazale), Harry\u2019s assistant, is waiting.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s interested in these people, anyway?\u201d Stan asks. One of Harry\u2019s crosses is that Stan is irreverent about their work, which to Harry is a sacred calling. Later we find out who\u2019s interested: Harry has been hired by the director of a large corporation (Robert Duvall), although at first he deals only with the man\u2019s assistant (Harrison Ford). It becomes clear that Ann, the young woman, is the director\u2019s wife, and Mark, the young man, is her lover. But what will happen next? \u201cHe\u2019d kill us if he had the chance,\u201d says Mark. Will he? Harry plays the tapes back and forth, juggling a bank of three tape recorders, in a scene Coppola says was partly inspired by the photographer trying to coax the truth out of his prints in Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s \u201cBlow-Up.\u201d Snatches of conversation advance and recede, maddeningly mixed with a band in the plaza that\u2019s playing \u201cRed, Red Robin.\u201d\n\nHarry is impatient with Stan, impatient with everyone. At home, he\u2019s shocked to find that his landlord entered his apartment, knows it is his birthday, and knows how old he is. On the phone, the landlord explains he needs his own key for an emergency. \u201cI\u2019d be perfectly happy if all my personal things burnt up in a fire,\u201d Harry tells him, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t have anything personal. Nothing of value--only my key.\u201d He visits his mistress Amy (Teri Garr). She knows it\u2019s him from the way he thinks he comes quietly through the door. She asks him to share something personal with her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any secrets,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a secret,\u201d she says.\n\nThe best supporting performance is by Allen Garfield, as Moran, Harry\u2019s successful competitor. At a trade show, Harry discovers that Stan has left him and gone to work for Moran. Yet he recklessly invites Moran, Stan and a crowd back to his office, an area behind steel mesh in an otherwise empty warehouse. He is humiliated to discover Moran bugged him, and of course later that night is betrayed by the hooker. A nightmare gives key information: As a child, Harry was paralyzed on one side, and nearly drowned during a bath. The word \u201cCaul\u201d has two meanings, both relevant: It is a spider\u2019s web, and the membrane that encloses a fetus. If it is found on a child\u2019s head after birth, we learn, \u201cit is supposed to protect against drowning.\u201d\n\nFrom his troubled childhood, Harry has grown up into a lonely man. He lives alone, has no entertainment except playing his saxophone with jazz records (again trying to make a recording more complete). No woman has any influence over him, that\u2019s for sure, or he wouldn\u2019t be seen in that crappy plastic raincoat, the kind that folds up into a travel pouch. His Catholicism is rooted not in faith and hope, but in shame. Searching his apartment for a hidden bug, he rips everything apart, but hesitates at a statue of the Virgin Mary.\n\nAs pure thriller, the movie works best during a scene where Harry checks into a hotel room next door to a rendezvous between Mark and Ann. Listening through the wall, he hears a struggle and perhaps a murder. His reaction is to hide in terror under the covers. Much later, when he enters the room, it\u2019s spick-and-span. But when he flushes the toilet, it overflows with bright red blood.\n\nMuch has been written about that scene. Is it real or imagined? The new DVD of \u201cThe Conversation\u201d has commentary tracks by both Coppola and Walter Murch, the editor and sound wizard, but neither addresses that question. Coppola says the scene was suggested by the shower scene in \u201cPsycho,\u201d and for Murch, the guilty evidence welling up reminds him of his adolescent shame when he tried to flush some porno magazines and they came floating back at just the wrong time. I think the scene is meant to be real. Later, the quick cuts of what might have happened in the room are, I think, Harry\u2019s speculations.\n\n\u201cThe Conversation\u201d comes from another time and place than today\u2019s thrillers, which are so often simple-minded. This movie is a sadly observant character study, about a man who has removed himself from life, thinks he can observe it dispassionately at an electronic remove, and finds that all of his barriers are worthless. The cinematography (opening scene by Haskell Wexler, the rest by Bill Butler) is deliberately planned from a voyeuristic point of view; we are always looking but imperfectly seeing. Here is a man who seeks the truth, and it always remains hidden. He plays the conversation over and over, but does Mark say, \u201cHe\u2019d kill us if he had the chance,\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019d kill us if he had the chance\u201d?", "running_time": 113, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1974, "date_published": "2001-02-04", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Mystery", "Suspense", "Thriller"], "title": "The Conversation (1974)"}
