I don't think it does. I never had the feeling during the film that\r\nit mattered much who won or lost, who lived or died, just so long as the\r\nspecial effects occurred on time and the movie's look of elegant chill was\r\npreserved.\u00a0\n\n\r\nIt was released at almost the same time as \u201cAltered\r\nStates,\u201d another horror film that was being linked with \u201cScanners\u201d in some\r\nreviews. I don't think they're comparable. I know \u201cAltered States\u201d cost many\r\nmillions of dollars more than \u201cScanners,\u201d but that's not the difference that\r\nmatters; on the level of its technical credits, \u201cScanners\u201d is a fully qualified\r\nthriller. What matters is that \u201cAltered States\u201d involved its characters in\r\nexperiences that we believed (for the length of the movie) were really\r\nhappening to them. Vicariously, they were happening to us, too. In \u201cScanners,\u201d\r\nwe're never involved. We're always watching. And so while \u201cAltered States\u201d throws\r\nall logic out the window and still works as great entertainment, \u201cScanners\u201d bogs\r\ndown in one of those plots where the big secret is revealed in the last reel\r\nand it turns out to be big only in the mind of the screenwriter.\u00a0\n\n\r\nThis was the fourth film by David Cronenberg, a\r\nCanadian who gathered a cult following for such superior low-budget chillers as\r\n\u201cThey Came from Within / Shivers\u201d and \u201cThe Brood.\u201d On the basis of \u201cScanners,\u201d his\r\nreputation is overextended. We forgive low-budget films their limitations,\r\nassuming that their directors would reach farther with more money. But \u201cScanners\u201d\r\nseems to indicate that what Cronenberg wants is enough money to make a better\r\nlow-budget movie.\u00a0\n\n\r\nThe film's story involves a breed of men and\r\nwomen who are \"scanners,\" who can pick up the thoughts of other people,\r\ncan enter their minds, and can mentally duel with them with such terrifying\r\nforce that their enemies may literally have their heads explode. An interesting\r\nmovie might have been made about the human plight of these mind-readers (what\r\nwould it be like to be able to eavesdrop on the thoughts of every miserable\r\nstraphanger on the way to work on the subway?). But \u201cScanners\u201d doesn't get into\r\nthe human implications very deeply.\u00a0\n\n\r\nInstead, it gives us a ready-made plot that\r\nseems recycled from old \u201cJames Bond\u201d movies and half-forgotten TV shows. It\r\nturns out that a large corporation has an interest in locating all living\r\nscanners, and using them for its own purposes. Two scanners (Jennifer O'Neill\r\nand Stephen Lack) fight for their independence. Their antagonists include an\r\nevil scientist and a good scientist, and of course everybody's motives are\r\nhopelessly entangled in the third act, even before the big surprise revelation.\u00a0\n\nThe problem with \u201cScanners\u201d is really very simple: It is\r\nabout its plot rather than about what happens to its characters. That is a big\r\ndifference. Movies that are about their plots force their characters through\r\ntheir predestined paces. Movies that are about characters seem to happen as\r\nwe're watching them. \u201cScanners\u201d is so lockstep that we are basically reduced to\r\nwatching the special effects, which are good but curiously abstract, because we\r\ndon't much care about the people they're happening around.", "running_time": 102, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1981, "date_published": "1981-01-01", "genres": ["Horror", "Science Fiction", "Thriller"], "title": "Scanners (1981)"}
