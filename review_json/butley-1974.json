But now his photograph of Eliot is peeling from the wall, and Butley is peeling, too. During the course of Simon Gray\u2019s \u201cButley,\u201d which was brilliantly directed for the American Film Theater by Harold Pinter, Butley peels off one layer, and then another, and finally comes down to his self-hating, desperately lonely core. \n\nButley is one of the most affecting characters of modern theater. He tries to bind people to himself with sarcasm, insult, and a merciless eye for their vulnerabilities. Eventually, it seems, he always fails. But the way Alan Bates plays him (and Bates, who created the role on the London stage, knows him as well as anybody), his mind is still resilient and panther-quick, with a streak of saving humor. So we don\u2019t pity him, even though we should. He somehow doggedly weathers each crisis, and we even feel a sneaky affection for him. Maybe that\u2019s the way the role is written, or maybe it\u2019s because of the double-reverse charm Bates brings to it; I couldn\u2019t quite tell. \n\nThe film takes place during a day in an office shared by two English instructors at Queen Mary\u2019s College, London. One is Butley, who, as he approaches middle age, has abandoned the difficulties of Eliot and taken up nursery rhymes. The other is Joey, who began as Butley\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, then became his roommate, and then (after Butley\u2019s marriage and separation) became his roommate again. Joey is as meticulous as Butley is a shambles. Butley spends his day in psychological warfare against the truths that would batter him down. His wife tells him she intends to marry another man. Bad enough. But then Joey acknowledges that he\u2019s leaving, too also for another man. Butley faces being left totally alone, and he fights back with wit, with obscenity, with insult, with booze. \n\nButley was born lonely, I\u2019d say. He needs to have somebody there. After his marriage fails, he needs Joey again, because Joey had at least admired him at one time. It doesn\u2019t really seem to be relevant that Joey is a homosexual; Butley\u2019s needs are not sexual but psychological. Butley doesn\u2019t have much affection for women: He has some feeling left for his wife, but conceals it well, and he has contempt for the other women in his day the spinster Byron scholar (played by Jessica Tandy) and the would-be tutorial student (Georgina Hale). True, but he doesn\u2019t succeed in acting much better with the men. His loneliness seems to be asexual, if anything. And his tragedy is that he can\u2019t admit his hungers and needs not until the play\u2019s end, anyway, when he makes an oblique but honest assessment of his current situation. Butley attempts to keep Joey by attacking his weaknesses, and he taunts Reg, Joey\u2019s new friend, in a futile attempt to drive him away. He\u2019s a dazzler with words, and even during the most pathetic scenes, he still somehow doesn\u2019t lose the poetry. \n\nThe Alan Bates performance reminded me of how good he was in a movie that never got a proper American playoff, \u201cA Day in the Death of Joe Egg.\u201d He gives the character so much spirit that the material never feels as depressing as it sounds. We get the feeling that here\u2019s one old campaigner who will stay on his feet no matter what, and give the bastards as good as he gets. The supporting cast (especially Richard O\u2019Callaghan as Joey) is also good, and Pinter\u2019s direction moves with such awareness of what the play is about that we\u2019re hardly conscious of any sense of filmed theater. The play hasn\u2019t been opened up so much as opened in: The camera gets closer to the characters and sees more. What it sees in Butley is a man with a desperate problem. He needs other people, and his only strategy for attracting them is to drive them away.", "running_time": 127, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1974, "date_published": "1974-01-01", "genres": ["Drama", "Foreign"], "title": "Butley (1974)"}
