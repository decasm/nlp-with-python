Maybe it\u2019s because we work in words, and stories are told in words, and it\u2019s harder to use words to paint pictures. But it might be worth a try.\n\n\u201cStormy Monday\u201d is about the way light falls on wet pavement stones, and about how a neon sign glows in a darkened doorway. It is about the attitudes that men strike when they feel in control of a situation, and the way their shoulders slump when someone else takes power. It is about smoking. It is about cleavage. It is about the look on a man\u2019s face when someone is about to deliberately break his arm, and he knows it. And about the look on a woman\u2019s face when she is waiting for a man she thinks she loves, and he is late, and she fears it is because he is dead.\n\n\u201cStormy Monday\u201d is also about symbols. It takes place mostly near the seedy waterfront of Newcastle, where a crooked Texas millionaire is trying to run a nightclub owner out of business so he can redevelop the area with laundered money. But now we\u2019re back to the story again. You see how easy it is to slip. The movie uses a lot of symbols of America: the flag, stretched large and bold behind a podium.\n\nBaton twirlers. A curiously frightening old man with a sinister smile, who struts in front of the baton twirlers, his shoulders thrown back, tipping his hat to the crowd. A car - big, fast, and red. Bourbon whiskey. Marlboros and cigars.\n\nIt is also about lonely furnished rooms, and rain, and standing in the window at night looking out into the street, and signaling for someone across a crowded nightclub floor, and about saxophones, which are the instrument of the night. It is about the flat, masked expressions on the faces of bodyguards, and about the face of a man who is consumed by anger. And it is about kissing, and about the look in a woman\u2019s eyes when she is about to kiss a man for the first time. And it is about high heels, and cleavage. I believe I already mentioned cleavage. Some images recur more naturally than others.\n\nThe movie is not all images. It is also about sounds. About the breathy, rich and yet uncertain tone of Melanie Griffith\u2019s voice, which makes her sound as if she\u2019s been around the track too many times and yet is still able to believe in love. And the flat, angry voice of Tommy Lee Jones, who never seems to raise his voice, or need to. And about the innocence in the voice of Sean Bean, an earnest young man who only wants a job and gets trapped in a bloodbath. And about the voice of Sting, who looks Jones in the eye and talks as flat and angry as he does, until Jones\u2019s shoulders slump. And about saxophones, the sound of the night.\n\nIt is also about the sound of a deliberately discordant performance of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d and about explosions and gunfire and squealing tires, and about modern jazz from Kracow. It is about the sound of ice cubes in a glass, and smoke being exhaled, and bones being broken. It is about the sound of a marching band, and about the voice of a disc jockey who wants to sound American and doesn\u2019t know when to stop. And about how a woman tells a man, \u201cI get off work at midnight.\u201d And how she looks when she says that. And how he looks.\n\nSo there\u2019s your review.", "running_time": 93, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-05-06", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "Foreign", "Romance", "Thriller"], "title": "Stormy Monday (1988)"}
