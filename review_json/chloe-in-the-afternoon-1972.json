It is also the most fully rounded, lacking the one-dimensional tone of some of his earlier tales. It\u2019s as if he were striking notes in the previous works, and is now bringing them all together into a chord; the final scene in \u201cChloe\u201d is his last comment on the series, and Rohmer is telling us to, for god\u2019s sake, stop playing games and embrace each other with honesty.\n\nGame playing is always his subject. He doesn\u2019t approve of it, but he\u2019s become obsessed with studying it. He isn\u2019t interested in making movies about people with shallow motives and obvious personalities (which is to say, about 90 per cent of the characters in movies). Rohmer\u2019s work contains surprises. People develop in unexpected ways. We don\u2019t know how to relate to them until well into the movie; they don\u2019t telegraph their intentions.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about Rohmer\u2019s characters is that they seem to retain free will. They aren\u2019t doomed, for example, to climb into the sack with each other at the end of the movie just because that\u2019s what usually happens. \u201cChloe in the Afternoon,\u201d like \u201cMy Night at Maud\u2019s,\u201d is in fact about an extended flirtation that doesn\u2019t get anywhere, and about the reaffirmation of an original love.\n\nRohmer\u2019s hero this time is Frederick, a pleasant if somewhat cool business executive who inhabits a marriage of the greatest simplicity and mutual respect. He and his wife, Helene, live like students -- not because they can\u2019t afford better, but because they enjoy the lack of bourgeois physical and mental clutter. It\u2019s one of those marriages that outsiders call \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nBut then Chloe materializes, right there in the middle of Frederick\u2019s afternoon. Frederick is a man who loves Paris, and who has arranged his work schedule so that he has his afternoons free for a sandwich, a little wandering, and his fantasies about the women of the city. It isn\u2019t that he desires them (although he daydreams of a magic amulet that could seduce them all), but that their beauty affirms his choice of a wife.\n\nChloe is one of these people blessed with the ability to insinuate themselves into your life while seeming to leave it. She forms an attachment with Frederick during a period when (he thinks) she is merely passing through. They meet in the afternoons. They flirt, but not too much. They talk.\n\nIt eventually develops that Chloe has selected Frederick to be the father of her baby. That\u2019s what Chloe says, anyway, and Frederick believes her; she\u2019s one of these modern women who would never get married, but would rather fancy having a perfect baby. (Cut to Bernard Shaw\u2019s famous retort to another such woman: \u201cBut, madam, what if the child had YOUR brains and MY body?\u201d)\n\nYou\u2019ll have to decide for yourself if Chloe really wants a baby. My personal notion is that she sees Frederick as merely a difficult exercise in seduction. She\u2019s a plain-beautiful woman who has just enough insecurity about herself to want to use her looks in order to confirm her attractiveness. For Frederick, however, it\u2019s a moral problem: How can he make love to Chloe when (as he believes) he is totally and deeply in love with his wife? Oh, you kid!\n\nThis description of the movie may make it sound inconsequential and meandering, but then Rohmer\u2019s movies always sound like that. Who else would make a whole movie, as he did, about Jerome\u2019s desire to caress the knee of Claire? Particularly as Jerome was not even a knee fetishist? What makes Rohmer\u2019s films so sparkling and intelligent is the way in which he watches his characters. Nothing escapes him, and he uses the angle of a glance, the tilt of a head, the precise set of a mouth, in order to create wonderfully complex characters.\n\nThe ending of \u201cChloe in the Afternoon\u201d releases an emotional time bomb that places the movie in a new, and deeper, context. When we see Rohmer\u2019s great last scene, the \u201cmoral tales\u201d fall into place. He has not been so very sophisticated after all, we realize; he has just been very good at seeing sophistication for what it is -- the highly developed art of avoiding simple, direct human relationships.", "running_time": 97, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1972, "date_published": "1972-12-28", "genres": ["Drama", "Foreign", "Romance"], "title": "Chloe in the Afternoon (1972)"}
