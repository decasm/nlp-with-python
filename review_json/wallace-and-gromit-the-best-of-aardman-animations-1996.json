That film was nominated for anOscar. Their next adventure, \u201cThe Wrong Trousers\u201d (1993), was a30-minute feature in which the greedy Wallace rents out Gromit's room to a penguin who is planning a robbery. Wallace, who is attempting to automate all aspects of his life, has meanwhile invented a pair of robotic trousers that complicate matters wonderfully.\n\n\u201cThe Wrong Trousers\u201d won the Academy Award for animation in1995, and a year later Park was back to the Oscar podium to accept another Oscar for his latest film, \u201cA Close Shave.\u201d It is this film, along with a selection of other animated work by Park, his associates and friends, that makes up \u201cWallace & Gromit: The Best of Aardman Animations,\u201d which runs through July 7 at the Music Box.\n\nAs \u201cA Close Shave\u201d opens, Wallace & Gromit have gone into the window-washing business, and encountered the formidable shopwoman Wendolene Ramsbottom, who runs a wool shop and has a robot \u201ccyberdog\u201d named Preston. Gromit instantly spots Preston as a phony, but Wallace isslow on the uptake, and soon they stumble over Preston's plot to employ an automatic sheep-shearing machine that clips the sheep and turns the wool into little pullovers, all in one operation. Nice enough, unless you're a sheep. Wallace & Gromit attempt to stop the evil experiment(which has meanwhile morphed into a Mutton-O-Matic machine), and the movie ends as all their adventures do, with a breakneck chase scene.\n\nAt 30 minutes, \u201cA Close Shave\u201d is the centerpiece of the Aardman program. The selection also includes \u201cWat's Pig,\u201d by Peter Lord, a story in which twins are separated at birth, one to grow up as a king, the other as a pauper. When enemy troops storm the castle (inscenes inspired by Eisenstein's \u201cAlexander Nevsky\u201d), the king substitutes the pauper for himself, with ironic results.\n\nNick Park has another of the nine films, \u201cCreature Comforts,\u201d in which zoo animals complain in patient middle-class English accents about their life behind bars. The turtle says he gets a lot of reading done. The lemur says, \u201cWhatever happens, they'll look after me.\u201d But a jungle cat grumbles that despite the technological advances at the zoo, it's short on space.\n\nAll of these films are animated in the same style, using Plasticine to create three-dimensional figures that move through real space one frame at a time (Tim Burton's \u201cJames and the Giant Peach\u201d uses a similar approach). The animators have to be able to visualize the drama of a scene, translate it into facial expressions and bodyl anguage, and then model the clay so that the emotions come through.\n\nThey are amazingly successful, most of all in the creation of Wallace & Gromit, who like Bugs and Elmer or Mickey and Minnie live in an enduring, sometimes baffling, comic relationship.", "running_time": 75, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 1996, "date_published": "1996-06-14", "genres": ["Animation"], "title": "Wallace & Gromit: The Best Of Aardman Animations (1996)"}
