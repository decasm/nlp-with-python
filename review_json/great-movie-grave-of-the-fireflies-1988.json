These bombs, longer than a tin can but about as big around, fall to earth trailing cloth tails that flutter behind them; they are almost a beautiful sight. After they hit, there is a moment\u2019s silence, and then they detonate, spraying their surroundings with flames. In a Japanese residential neighborhood, made of flimsy wood and paper houses, there is no way to fight the fires.\n\n\u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d (1988) is an animated film telling the story of two children from the port city of Kobe, made homeless by the bombs. Seita is a young teenager, and his sister Setsuko is about 5. Their father is serving in the Japanese navy, and their mother is a bomb victim; Seita kneels beside her body, covered with burns, in an emergency hospital. Their home, neighbors, schools are all gone. For a time an aunt takes them in, but she\u2019s cruel about the need to feed them, and eventually Seita finds a hillside cave where they can live. He does what he can to find food, and to answer Setsuko\u2019s questions about their parents. The first shot of the film shows Seita dead in a subway station, and so we can guess Setsuko\u2019s fate; we are accompanied through flashbacks by the boy\u2019s spirit.\n\n\u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d is an emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation. Since the earliest days, most animated films have been \u201ccartoons\u201d for children and families. Recent animated features such as \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cPrincess Mononoke\u201d and \u201cThe Iron Giant\u201d have touched on more serious themes, and the \u201cToy Story\u201d movies and classics like \u201cBambi\u201d have had moments that moved some audience members to tears. But these films exist within safe confines; they inspire tears, but not grief. \u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d is a powerful dramatic film that happens to be animated, and I know what the critic Ernest Rister means when he compares it to \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and says, \u201cIt is the most profoundly human animated film I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nIt tells a simple story of survival. The boy and his sister must find a place to stay, and food to eat. In wartime their relatives are not kind or generous, and after their aunt sells their mother\u2019s kimonos for rice, she keeps a lot of the rice for herself. Eventually, Seita realizes it is time to leave. He has some money and can buy food--but soon there is no food to buy. His sister grows weaker. Their story is told not as melodrama, but simply, directly, in the neorealist tradition. And there is time for silence in it. One of the film\u2019s greatest gifts is its patience; shots are held so we can think about them, characters are glimpsed in private moments, atmosphere and nature are given time to establish themselves.\n\nJapanese poets use \u201cpillow words\u201d that are halfway between pauses and punctuation, and the great director Yasujiro Ozu uses \u201cpillow shots\u201d--a detail from nature, say, to separate two scenes. \u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d uses them, too. Its visuals create a kind of poetry. There are moments of quick action, as when the bombs rain down and terrified people fill the streets, but this film doesn\u2019t exploit action; it meditates on its consequences.\n\nThe film was directed by Isao Takahata, who is associated with the famous Ghibli Studio, source of the greatest Japanese animation. His colleague there is Hayao Miyazaki (\u201cPrincess Mononoke,\u201d \u201cKiki\u2019s Delivery Service,\u201d \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d). His films are not usually this serious, but \u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d is in a category by itself. It\u2019s based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Nosaka Akiyuki--who was a boy at the time of the firebombs, whose sister did die of hunger and whose life has been shadowed by guilt.\n\nThe book is well-known in Japan, and might easily have inspired a live-action film. It isn\u2019t the typical material of animation. But for \u201cGrave of the Fireflies,\u201d I think animation was the right choice. Live action would have been burdened by the weight of special effects, violence and action. Animation allows Takahata to concentrate on the essence of the story, and the lack of visual realism in his animated characters allows our imagination more play; freed from the literal fact of real actors, we can more easily merge the characters with our own associations.\n\nHollywood animation has been pursuing the ideal of \u201crealistic animation\u201d for decades, even though that\u2019s an oxymoron. People who are drawn do not look like people who are photographed. They\u2019re more stylized, more obviously symbolic, and (as Disney discovered in painstaking experiments) their movements can be exaggerated to communicate mood through body language. \u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d doesn\u2019t attempt even the realism of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d or \u201cPrincess Mononoke,\u201d but paradoxically it is the most realistic animated film I\u2019ve ever seen--in feeling.\n\nThe locations and backgrounds are drawn in a style owing something to the 18th century Japanese artist Hiroshige and his modern disciple Herge (the creator of Tin Tin). There is great beauty in them--not cartoon beauty, but evocative landscape drawing, put through the filter of animated style. The characters are typical of much modern Japanese animation, with their enormous eyes, childlike bodies and features of great plasticity (mouths are tiny when closed, but enormous when opened in a child\u2019s cry--we even see Setsuko\u2019s tonsils). This film proves, if it needs proving, that animation produces emotional effects not by reproducing reality, but by heightening and simplifying it, so that many of the sequences are about ideas, not experiences.\n\nThere are individual moments of great beauty. One involves a night when the children catch fireflies and use them to illuminate their cave. The next day, Seita finds his little sister carefully burying the dead insects--as she imagines her mother was buried. There is another sequence in which the girl prepares \u201cdinner\u201d for her brother by using mud to make \u201crice balls\u201d and other imaginary delicacies. And note the timing and the use of silence in a sequence where they find a dead body on the beach, and then more bombers appear far away in the sky.\n\nRister singles out another shot: \u201cThere\u2019s a moment where the boy Seita traps an air bubble with a wash rag, submerges it, and then releases it into his sister Setsuko\u2019s delighted face--and that\u2019s when I knew I was watching something special.\u201d\n\nThere are ancient Japanese cultural currents flowing beneath the surface of \u201cGrave of the Fireflies,\u201d and they\u2019re explained by critic Dennis H. Fukushima Jr., who finds the story\u2019s origins in the tradition of double-suicide plays. It is not that Seita and Setsuko commit suicide overtly, but that life wears away their will to live. He also draws a parallel between their sheltering cave and hillside tombs.\n\nFukushima cites an interview with the author, Akiyuki: \u201cHaving been the sole survivor, he felt guilty for the death of his sister. While scrounging for food, he had often fed himself first, and his sister second. Her undeniable cause of death was hunger, and it was a sad fact that would haunt Nosaka for years. It prompted him to write about the experience, in hopes of purging the demons tormenting him.\u201d\n\nBecause it is animated and from Japan, \u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d has been little seen. When anime fans say how good the film is, nobody takes them seriously. Now that it\u2019s available on DVD with a choice of subtitles or English dubbing, maybe it will find the attention it deserves. Yes, it\u2019s a cartoon, and the kids have eyes like saucers, but it belongs on any list of the greatest war films ever made.", "running_time": 89, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "2000-03-19", "genres": ["Animation"], "title": "Grave of the Fireflies (1988)"}
