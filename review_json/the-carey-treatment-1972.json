Well, as my colleague Ron Powers has ably documented in a series of recent essays on Televese, most dialog on television is devoid of useful information. Especially on the soap operas and the doctor-nurse programs, people speak only in order NOT to say what is on everybody\u2019s mind.\n\nThe wealthy senator\u2019s brilliant daughter is dying of a rare, incurable disease - and may lose her baby and infect her cocker spaniel - and everybody talks to her about the weather. You can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s happening by listening to the audio. You have to watch. All the information comes in the silences between the speeches. A nurse says, \u201cDoctor, you mean . . .?\u201d And then it is tip to the doctor\u2019s eyelashes. He must move several hundred hairs through a sixteenth of an inch of space in such a way as to convey a complex diagnosis. He does so. \u201cOh my God!\u201d the nurse gasps. The doctor nods grimly.\n\nIn a movie, of course, you have a larger screen and don\u2019t have to use close-ups so much. That is true in theory, anyway, but TV\u2019s recent breakthroughs in brow and lash work have apparently had an influence, and Blake Edwards\u2019 \u201cThe Carey Treatment\u201d is awfully ocular.\n\nThe problem is in the script. There are long, sterile patches of dialog during which nothing at all is communicated. These are no doubt important in order to convey the essential meaninglessness of life, but how can a director make them interesting? Edwards tries. He\u2019s stuck with a love interest between James Coburn and Jennifer O\u2019Neill that has nothing to do with the film. (Love interests have lately had less and less to do with the films they\u2019re in.) So Edwards goes the eye route. James Coburn has maybe the best set of eyelashes among current male stars (Robert Redford is second, I\u2019d say) and does a commendable job.\n\nThe sad thing is that the movie\u2019s hopefully a thriller. It\u2019s one of your slices-of-life dramas about everyday events in a large metropolitan hospital. The hospital administrator\u2019s daughter has died after an unnecessary abortion, and renegade physician Coburn dedicates himself to saving the reputation of the brilliant young Chinese surgeon who has been unjustly accused of the crime. His investigation puts him on the trail of a sadistic masseur in a seedy steam bath, whose dope fiend girlfriend has been stealing cocaine from suffering elderly patients. As I say, it\u2019s all stuff that happens every day in your typical hospital.\n\nAnyway, for no good reason, Edwards has decided to tone down his plot by throwing in all these dead scenes filled with dead dialog. Coburn works his brows for all they\u2019re worth, and it comes as a surprise late in the film when a colleague says to him: \u201cDon\u2019t try to talk! Just blink your eyes - once for yes, twice for no.\u201d How insulting. Like asking Marcel Marceau to walk up a flight of stairs, or Segovia if he plays the uke.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1972, "date_published": "1972-04-05", "genres": null, "title": "The Carey Treatment (1972)"}
