{"url": "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-fountain-2007", "by": "Hugh Jackmanas Tomas/Tommy/Tom Creo", "star_rating": 2.5, "text": "As a believer that Darren Aronofsky is one of the rare originals among the recent class of new directors, I was eager to double back and view his \u201cThe Fountain\u201d (2006), a movie about immortality that was released just about the time my own was being called into question.\n\nAlthough as a doctoral candidate in English I was advised to be familiar with the existing criticism on a work before venturing to write my own, as a film critic I am usually writing before other reviews have even been published. But a year had passed. So after looking at the film, I checked out IMDb\u2019s \u201cexternal reviews\u201d section and discovered that, good lord, 221 reviews had been written on \u201cThe Fountain.\u201d On other sites I discovered that its Metacritic rating was 51 (out of 100) and it scored exactly the same on the Tomatometer. Urgent to Aronofsky: Remember that when Terry Zwigoff was sleeping with that gun under his pillow, he still had \u201cCrumb,\u201d \u201cGhost World\u201d and \u201cBad Santa\u201d ahead of him.\n\nHow bad could \u201cThe Fountain\u201d be? I selected one review, Variety\u2019s, because it was written from the premiere at Venice and was the first word on the film. I found that the \u201cone-time wunderkind,\u201d who had been \u201coverpraised for the then-hip, now-dated use of pseudo-science in \"Pi,\" and for the visual excess he deployed in the grungy \"Requiem for a Dream\",\u201d had now committed a film in which Hugh Jackman stars in \u201cthree stories in different time frames and switches throughout somewhat abruptly between them, although auds can parse which is going on when by paying attention to how much hair Jackman is sporting at any given time.\u201d\n\nI was relieved to find that pseudo-science and visual excess are now behind us in the cinema. But let\u2019s talk about hair. In the first story, Jackman portrays a conquistador, in the second he is a modern scientist, and in the third he is bald and floating through space inside a magical bubble. Auds who cannot parse that must be plumb parsed out. And why trash Aronofsky\u2019s first two films, just when I was trying to decide which I would write about as a Great Movie? He made \u201cPi\u201d at 29 (best director, Sundance), \u201cRequiem\u201d at 31 (Oscar nom for Ellen Burstyn), and now, at 37, he was already a \u201conetime wunderkind.\u201d Scott Fitzgerald said American lives don\u2019t have  second acts; he never said they don\u2019t have first ones.\n\nIs the film a success? Not for most people, no. I imagine they don\u2019t realize, for one thing, that it all takes place in the present and there is only one \u201creal\u201d Hugh Jackman character, Tommy. The conquistador named Tomas is the hero of the novel his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz) is writing, and the spaceman named Tom Creo is the hero of that novel\u2019s final chapter, which Tommy writes after his deathbed promise to his wife.  Creo  is Spanish for \u201cI believe,\u201d Spanish is a language the conquistador would speak, and Tommy believes that a cure will be found for death. The tree sharing the space bubble with Tom is the Tree of Life that Tomas was seeking in the early chapters, and the movie explains that the bubble is en route to that nebula he and Izzy see in the sky, which (she would know and explain) was believed by the Mayans to be the origin of life.\n\nI could go on like this, but having searched the 18,326 messages in my g-mail account, I find that one reader, Matt Withers of Brunswick, MD has it all figured out in elegant detail. His explanation will be found elsewhere on this site.\n\nCan a typical aud member be expected to do the heavy parsing that would figure all this out? I doubt it. Most movies, you like to have them all parsed before you buy the ticket. Did I have it figured out? It didn\u2019t take me long, and here was my thinking: Since there is not a single element in the film claiming that the same man is alive in all three time periods, he obviously is not. There is a critical belief that you should not bring story elements to fiction that cannot be found there. The fictional identity of the first man is explained by Izzy\u2019s novel, in which she would obviously visualize her own lover as the hero. The fictional nature of the third man is explained because, hey, people don\u2019t go floating through the cosmos inside a bubble while levitating and eating bark, even in \u201cthe future.\u201d There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy, but not that. Stephen Hawking will back me up. The film\u2019s central section is unalloyed realism, and generates the fantasy of the first and third. Since Izzy dies in it, magic isn\u2019t allowed. Fiction sets its rules.\n\nThat said, I will concede the film is not a great success. Too many screens of blinding lights. Too many transitions for their own sake. Abrupt changes of tone. And yet I believe we have not seen the real film. When a $75 million production goes into turnaround and is made for $35 million, elements get eliminated. When a film telling three stories and spanning thousands of years has a running time of 96 minutes, scenes must have been cut out. There will someday be a Director\u2019s Cut of this movie, and that\u2019s the cut I want to see.", "running_time": 96, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 2007, "date_published": "2007-09-13", "genres": ["Adventure", "Drama", "Romance", "Science Fiction"], "title": "The Fountain (2007)"}
