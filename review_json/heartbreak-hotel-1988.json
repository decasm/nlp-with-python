We all know it\u2019s bad manners to talk during a movie, but every once in a while a film comes along that positively requires the audience to shout helpful suggestions and lewd one-liners at the screen. \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d is such a movie. All it needs to be perfect is a parallel soundtrack.\n\nThe film tells the story of an Ohio high school kid (Charlie Schlatter), back in 1972, who has his own rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band. But the fuddy-duddys on the high school faculty don\u2019t like rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, so they ban the band from the school talent show. Meanwhile, the kid has problems at home. His divorced mother (Tuesday Weld) is an alcoholic who sleeps with a guy who works at the junkyard. She\u2019s also a die-hard Elvis Presley fan. Things are not so great at home for Schlatter and his kid sister, who live upstairs over Mom\u2019s business, a fleabag motel.\n\nAnd things get worse when Weld is hospitalized after a traffic accident.\n\nWhat to do? Well, Elvis himself is going to appear in Cleveland on Saturday night, and so Schlatter and the members of his band concoct a desperate plot to kidnap Presley and bring him home, to cheer up Mom.\n\nHow are they going to get him away from his cocoon of security guards? They come up with a brainstorm. Rosie, the local pizza cook, looks exactly like Elvis\u2019 beloved dead mother. So they\u2019ll give her a black wig, adjust her makeup and convince Elvis that she has returned from the grave for one last visit with her son. Rosie, portrayed by Jacque Lynn Colton in a role the late Divine was born to play, sends Elvis flowers and lures him outside his hotel at 3 a.m., and then the high school kids chloroform him and whisk him away in a pink Cadillac.\n\nOnce Elvis enters the plot, the movie ascends new heights of silliness. Elvis, played in the film by David Keith (a good actor who doesn\u2019t look one bit like Elvis), is mad at first, of course. But then he begins to listen when this teenage punk tells him he has lost his sense of danger and is playing it safe for his fans, who are mostly blue-haired old ladies. Elvis also sort of falls for Weld, and he takes a special liking in his heart for her little daughter, Pam (Angela Goethals), who is afraid to sleep with the lights out. The tender bedside scenes between Elvis and the young girl are hard to watch with a straight face, especially if you\u2019ve read Albert Goldman\u2019s muckraking biography Elvis, with its revelations about the King\u2019s taste in pubescent girls.\n\nI don\u2019t know what Chris Columbus, the writer and director of this film, had in mind when he made it. One of my fellow critics, emerging from the screening and wiping tears of incredulous laughter from his eyes, said maybe they were trying to make a Frank Capra film - \u201cMr. Presley Goes to Ohio.\u201d Elvis gives Schlatter tips on picking up women and holds lessons in pelvis-grinding before agreeing to make a guest appearance at the high school talent show. Any resemblance between this behavior and the real Presley exists only in the realm of fantasy.\n\nAnd yet Elvis fans are a special lot and will enjoy some of the small touches in the film, such as the name of Weld\u2019s motel (the \u201cFlaming Star\u201d) and the way the movie reproduces the famous jukebox dance and fight scene from one of Presley\u2019s aging classics. Some scenes are tongue-in-cheek send-ups of hoary old B-movie cliches, as when Elvis grabs a paintbrush and helps Weld redecorate her motel or when he says a tearful goodbye at the airport before flying back to reality in his private jet (he reserves an especially fond pat on the head for the young daughter).\n\nI never know how to deal with movies like \u201cHeartbreak Hotel.\u201d Sure, it\u2019s bad - awesomely bad, contrived, awkward and filled with unintentional laughs. And yet I was not bored. The movie finds so many different approaches to its badness that it becomes endearing. The organizers of Golden Turkey film festivals have been complaining lately that they don\u2019t make truly great bad movies anymore. \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d is proof that the genre is not completely dead.", "running_time": 102, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-09-30", "genres": ["Comedy", "Music"], "title": "Heartbreak Hotel (1988)"}
