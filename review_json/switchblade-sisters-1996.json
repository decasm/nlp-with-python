The dialogue clanked along from one dumb profundity to another, and the sentiments were as pious as political speeches. One of the characters in \u201cSwitchblade Sisters\u201d (1975) quotes approvingly from Mao's Little Red Book, although enlightenment among the Sisters is not universal: After the leader of a boy gang rapes a new member of a girl gang, he asks, \u201cYou all right? You were asking for it.\u201d She is inclined to agree. \u201cSwitchblade Sisters\u201d is one of the countless films viewed by Quentin Tarantino during his now-legendary employment at Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, Calif. (the store owner should get a finder's fee based on QT's subsequent career). Now Tarantino has started a division of Miramax named Rolling Thunder Pictures to re-release some of his discoveries. After \u201cSwitchblade Sisters\u201d we are promised \u201cMighty Peking Man\u201d (1977), the 1964 Italian horror film \u201cBlood and Black Lace\u201d and the 1973 blaxploitation epic \u201cDetroit 9000.\u201d Exploitation films can be a lot of fun. The director of \"Switchblade Sisters,\" Jack Hill, directed 16 of them, including two of my favorites, the Pam Grier films \"Coffy\" and \"Foxy Brown.\" His other titles included \u201cSwinging Cheerleaders.\u201d \u201cThe Big Bird Cage,\u201d \u201cSnake People,\u201d \u201cBlood Bath,\u201d and \u201cSpider Baby.\u201d Often they were released more than once, under various titles; \u201cSpider Baby\u201d became \u201cThe Liver Eaters,\u201d and \u201cSwitchblade Sisters\u201d was also known as \u201cThe Jezebels\u201d and \u201cThe Playgirl Gang.\u201d What made the Pam Grier pictures stand out was Grier's own charisma; she was an authentic movie star, and even Hill's sleazy production values and slapdash photography and editing couldn't conceal her talent. The problem with \u201cSwitchblade Sisters\u201d is that no one on screen is any better than the talent behind the camera. The movie is badly acted, written and directed, and while I was watching it I realized that in some unexplained but happy way, the basic level of cinematic talent has improved in the past two decades. Few new directors today could make a film this bad. Low budgets have nothing to do with it. Consider Robert Rodriguez (whose \u201cEl Mariachi\u201d cost $8,000), Matty Rich (\u201cStraight Out of Brooklyn,\u201d $24,000) and Edward Burns (\u201cThe Brothers McMullen,\u201d $28,000). Despite their budgets, they are born filmmakers who know where to put a camera, how to write a script, how to cast and direct actors, and how to move things along. By contrast, \u201cSwitchblade Sisters\u201d is a series of tableaus in which stiff actors are grouped in awkwardly composed shots to say things like \u201cFreeze, greaseball!\u201d The greaseball, by the way, is a sadistic bill collector trying to collect $40 in back payments on a TV set owned by a tearful welfare mother in a building that is otherwise apparently occupied only by Switchblade Sisters. As he takes the elevator to the street, another Sister gets on at every floor (are they psychic, or did they phone ahead and plan the elevator ride?). When they reach the ground floor, the greaseball gets his tie cut off. Heavy. The plot involves a girl gang named the Jezebels that hangs out at a burger stand. Maggie (Joanne Nail), a new girl in the neighborhood, refuses to give her seat to Lace (Robbie Lee), the Jezebels' leader, and that leads to a fight but also to mutual respect. Soon Dominic (Asher Brauner), the leader of the Silver Blades, rapes Maggie--and since he is Lace's boyfriend, this creates a certain tension. One thing leads to another, as the script hurries from cliche to cliche.\n\nThe Jezebels are jailed, where they are mistreated by a lesbian warden before getting their revenge. Later there's a hilarious rumble in a roller rink--it's a shoot-out on skates with automatic weapons--that seems to leave dozens dead, although all but one of the key characters survives. The movie is wallpapered with the slogans of the era. The cops are \u201cpigs,\u201d the Black Power girl gang is the repository of revolutionary wisdom, there is solidarity between the girl gangs, and at some point we are astonished to be given the information that all of these characters are still in highschool, and as juveniles, cannot be tried for what seems like a citywide crime wave. The only real reason for seeing \u201cSwitchblade Sisters\u201d would be to condescend to it, to snicker at its badness. But there are degrees of bad, and this movie falls far below Pauline Kael's notion of \u201cgreat trash.\u201d There is also some amusement to be had from the costumes: the mile wide shirt collars, leather vests and plaid pants on the men, and the hot pants and thigh boots on the women. But such pleasures are small. Should you actually pay money to see this movie at a time when \u201cWelcome to the Dollhouse,\u201d \u201cThe Rock,\u201d \u201cNelly and Monsieur Arnaud,\u201d \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d and \u201cI Shot Andy Warhol\u201d are playing? I don't think so.", "running_time": 90, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1996, "date_published": "1996-06-21", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "Indie"], "title": "Switchblade Sisters (1996)"}
