At a family reunion or a tennis tournament, it\u2019s always the same. The first thing people ask is, Where's the band? When you hear the music, when you\u2019re doing the old dances, you just feel good, that's all.\u201d\n\nFor more than 50 years in South Chicago, down where the city begins to move East beneath Lake Michigan and toward the steel mills of Gary, the band that made Serbian-Americans dance and feel the best was the Popovich Brothers Tamburitza Orchestra. And now the Popoviches (Adam, Ted and Marko) and their fellow band member Pete Mistovich have been made the subject of a documentary by Jill Godmilow, the same filmmaker who teamed up with folk singer Judy Collins to make the Academy Award nominee \u201cAntonia: Portrait of a Woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Popovich Brothers of South Chicago\u201d has its world premiere this week at the Film Center of the Art Institute. It is filled with songs and life, with the lilting, driving, sometimes sad music of Serbia, but it\u2019s not a musical: It\u2019s a study of the ways ethnic traditions are transplanted to America and last for generations in a culture that\u2019s allegedly a melting pot.\n\nThe Popovich brothers provide Godmilow with an ideal microcosm of her larger subject. The brothers come from a family of 10. Their father, Nikola, who died at 94 during the shooting of the film, immigrated to the United States in 1902, laid rails in Michigan, mined silver in Colorado, and in Denver met and married his wife, Ljubica.\n\nShe was as responsible as anyone for the family\u2019s musical background, the brothers remember: She encouraged them to take music lessons, she shared her love and knowledge of Serbian music, and she helped plan the family orchestra\u2019s first tours - when, by train and car, they toured the Serbian communities of the West and then settled permanently in Chicago before taking on the rest of the country. (Their early days in show business remind me a little of the legendary Minnie Marx, masterminding the Marx Brothers\u2019 assaults on the vaudeville circuits).\n\nIn this new film, as in \u201cAntonia\u201d (which was shown in a shorter version on CBS\u2019 60 Minutes), Godmilow makes the music part of a larger statement about society. \u201cAntonia\u201d asked why a talented symphony orchestra conductor was never able to fully use her talent because she was a woman. \u201cThe Popovich Brothers\u201d is more upbeat: It marvels at the fact that an ethnic musical culture cannot only survive to the third and fourth generations in America, but prosper.\n\nWe get a feeling for the reasons why in the film\u2019s opening sequences, as thousands of Serbian-Americans from all over the country gather for a banquet and concert honoring the orchestra\u2019s 50th year. We get more of it hearing the Popoviches play, and seeing people dance, and listening to the free-wheeling memories and opinions Godmilow draws from the brothers, their relatives and their friends.\n\nThe young woman at the tennis tournament, for example, is sitting next to her husband. He was from Chicago, she lived in Milwaukee, and they met at a Serbian picnic. They found they shared the same opinions about what was important in life, she says, mentioning ideas about families, children \u201cand, of course, music and dancing.\u201d Godmilow also interviews a young Serb who\u2019s a successful attorney: \u201cMy grandfather\u2019s generation, when they went down in the mines, I can only imagine how hard that work was and how they felt when they came up again. But they always found time in the evening to play the music, and when they were dancing, for those minutes or hours, they could be themselves. It was a very important freedom.\u201d\n\nGodmilow uses headlines from both ethnic and general newspapers to subtly suggest the integration of an ethnic group into society: A Serb becomes the first congresswoman from California, another wins a gold medal in the Olympics. \u201cBut the young people still seem to love the music and the traditions,\u201d Adam Popovich observes. And the film\u2019s last sequence makes the point. After the unexpected death of Marco Popovich in 1976, it appeared for a time that the band might break up. But the vacant place in the band was filled -- by a young musician two generations further down the line.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": "Unrated", "release_year": 1978, "date_published": "1978-03-28", "genres": null, "title": "The Popovich Brothers of South Chicago (1978)"}
