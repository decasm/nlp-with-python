Yes, it\u2019s possible: in vitro fertilization assured a perfect match. And no, this isn\u2019t science fiction like Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s Never Let Me Go, with its cloned human replacements. It\u2019s just a little girl subjected to major procedures almost from birth to help her sister live.\n\nSo far they have succeeded, and Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) is alive long after her predicted death at 5. Her sister, Anna (Abigail Breslin), has donated blood, bone marrow and stem cells, and now is being told she must donate one of her kidneys. She\u2019s had it. It dismays her to know she was conceived as an organ bank, and she wants her chance at a normal life without round trips to the operating room. She may be young but she\u2019s bright and determined, and she decides to file a lawsuit against her parents for \u201cmedical emancipation.\u201d\n\nShe would be a model family if not for her sister\u2019s death sentence. Her mom, Sara (Cameron Diaz), was a successful Los Angeles lawyer. Her dad, Brian (Jason Patric), is a fire chief. Her older brother, Jesse (Evan Ellingson), is a good student, but feels ignored. Anna and Kate love each other dearly. But always there is Sara\u2019s relentless drive to keep her daughter alive. Like some successful attorneys, she also wants to win every case in her private life.\n\nAnna goes to an attorney who boasts a 90 percent success rate in his TV ads. This is the polished Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin), who drives a Bentley convertible and is known for bringing his dog into courtrooms. Sara offers her savings of $700. This is far under his fee, but he listens and accepts the case.\n\nAlthough \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d based on the best-seller by Jodi Picoult, is an effective tearjerker, if you think about it, it\u2019s something else. The movie never says so, but it\u2019s a practical parable about the debate between pro-choice and pro-life. If you\u2019re pro-life, you would require Anna to donate her kidney, although there is a chance she could die, and her sister doesn\u2019t have a good prognosis. If you\u2019re pro-choice, you would support Anna\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe mother is appalled by the lawsuit. Keeping her daughter alive has been a triumph for her all of these years. The father is shocked, too, but calmer and more objective. He can see Anna\u2019s point. She has her own life to live, and her own love to demand. The performances don\u2019t go over the top, although they can see it from where they\u2019re standing. Cameron Diaz has the greatest challenge because her determination is so fierce, but she makes her love evident \u2014 more for Kate, it must be said, than for Anna and Jesse. Jason Patric too rarely gets sympathetic roles, and embodies thoughtfulness and tenderness here. The young actors never step wrong.\n\nNicely nuanced, too, is Alec Baldwin as the hot-shot attorney. He doesn\u2019t have a posh office, and his photo is plastered on billboards, but he\u2019s not a fly-by-night, and he has a heart. He also has a sense of humor; in several supporting roles recently, He has stepped in with lines enriched by unexpected flashes of wit. Also navigating around cliches here is Joan Cusack as the judge. She takes that impossible case and convinces us she handles it about as well as possible. The enigma is the underdeveloped brother, Jesse, who runs away for three days.\n\nWe\u2019re never told what that was all about; in the film, it serves merely to distract us when Taylor (Thomas Dekker), Kate\u2019s fellow cancer patient, seems to disappear. The hospital romance between Taylor and Kate is one of the best elements of the movie, tender, tactful and very touching.\n\nThe screenplay by Jeremy Leven and Nick Cassavetes (who also directed) is admirable in trusting us to figure things out. Because it\u2019s obvious in one beautiful scene that Kate is wearing a wig, they don\u2019t ask, \u201cWill the audience understand that?\u201d and add a jarring line. Routine courtroom theatrics are avoided. We learn of the verdict in the best way. We can see the wheels turning, but they turn well.\n\n\u00a0", "running_time": 109, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 2009, "date_published": "2009-06-24", "genres": ["Drama"], "title": "My Sister's Keeper (2009)"}
