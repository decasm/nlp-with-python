It is, indeed, a triumph over that work; using most of the same words and music, it succeeds in being light instead of turgid, outward-looking instead of narcissistic. Jewison, a director of large talent, has taken a piece of commercial shlock and turned it into a Biblical movie with dignity.\n\nThat isn\u2019t easy to do. The life of Christ would seem to have an innate dignity to it, but only in such rare films as Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s \u201cThe Gospel According to St. Matthew\u201d or Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d has Christ come off as human, strong and reachable. The character has a tendency to disintegrate before our eyes; it\u2019s the only male role we can imagine where the cinematographer considers gauze over the lens. Christ seems wispy and too ethereal, and Mary Magdalene begins to steal scenes. The lowest point in this sort of thing was reached by Jeffrey Hunter as Christ in the remake of \u201cKing of Kings\u201d--but let that memory steal quietly away.\n\nNorman Jewison gives us a likable Christ in Ted Neeley, who sometimes seems a little bemused by his superstar status. The premise of the movie is that Christ was the first superstar--the first man with a hyperthyroid charisma. The ordinary people around him begin to get a little worried after a while; they like him and don\u2019t want him to get in trouble with the Romans. Most worried of all is Judas, who advises Christ to maintain a low profile.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t of course; but in deference to the several readers who didn\u2019t like my review of \u201cThe Last of Sheila\u201d because I gave away too much of the plot, I won\u2019t reveal what happens to Christ in the end. Along the way, though, Jewison and his cinematographer Douglas Slocombe give us some of the most spectacular wide screen photography since \u201cDoctor Zhivago,\u201d and they achieve a color range that glows with life and somehow doesn\u2019t make the desert look barren.\n\nIndividual moments have such beauty and grace that you\u2019re afraid to think of the pains that must have been necessary to get them. There are extreme long shots of characters isolated in a vast wilderness; there are lonely shots into the sun of ancient monuments; and there\u2019s one absolutely stunning shot that shows us an apparently empty landscape and then tilts down to reveal Jesus and his disciples in a gigantic, sunlit cavern.\n\nThe movie has become controversial for a couple of reasons: Jewish groups have attacked it for being anti-Semitic, and some reviewers have wondered aloud why the only black in the movie happened to be cast as Judas. Jewison is wrong, of course, to blame the death of Jesus on the Jews; the Roman Catholic Church, which hasn\u2019t exactly been in the vanguard on this question, officially decided some years ago that the doctrine of collective Jewish responsibility was in error. That\u2019s in line with the historical scholarship on the subject. But Jewison is dealing with a fantasy about the life of Christ, not fact, and if he wants to typecast, that\u2019s his right as a filmmaker. We also have the right to be offended.\n\nAs for the black Judas, I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to be concerned after seeing Carl Anderson\u2019s fine performance in the role. He has an energy and strength that makes Judas seem recognizably human, for a change, instead of that vapid little sneak over on the right-hand side of the canvas with the bag in his hand. Jewison suggests that Judas (by his own lights, anyway) had a legitimate concern about Christ\u2019s popularity. And in the Jewison version, Judas doesn\u2019t so much as betray Christ for the pieces of silver as make a tactical error in his dealings with the Romans. Interesting.\n\nThe music is clear and bouncy, and the movie sound track album should be a better version of the rock opera than the original. Jewison is especially good with peppy numbers like \u201cWhat\u2019s the Buzz?\u201d and we never get the feeling he\u2019s manipulating his characters or forcing them into staged-looking choreography. They inhabit the desert freely, enacting their story as if it were not the central event in the Christian religion but rather the interesting career of a promising young man.", "running_time": 103, "mpaa_rating": "G", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-08-15", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Music"], "title": "Jesus Christ Superstar (1973)"}
