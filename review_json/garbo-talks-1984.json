The movie tells the story of a dying woman whose last wish is to meet Greta Garbo, the legendary recluse. The woman\u2019s son, who never has been able to assert himself about anything in his life, vows to find Garbo and bring her to his mother\u2019s bedside. The movie ends after Garbo has arrived at the bedside.\n\nNow stop for a moment and imagine. What would you like to have happen? Would you like Garbo to talk with the dying woman? Would you like her to offer the kind of mysterious, haunting tenderness and sympathy she projected in her movies? Would you like her to make the dying woman\u2019s life more interesting, by revealing the secrets of her last 43 years spent out of the public eye? If you would, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re in for a big disappointment.\n\nGarbo is treated in this movie like an icon. We see only a glimpse of her face. The rest of the time, there\u2019s her stylish hair, above the collar of a fashionable coat, seen from behind. And when she walks into the hospital room, the dying woman, played by Anne Bancroft, does a thing so incredible you can believe it only because it\u2019s in a movie \u2013 especially because it\u2019s in a movie. She begins delivering a monologue to Garbo.\n\nThe camera zooms in slowly as Bancroft emotes tearfully about her life, her loves, her hopes, her dreams. Is that why she wanted to meet Garbo? To have someone to talk to?\n\nThe Bancroft character is one of those patented movie heroines who is supposed to be a wild and color\u00adful character: Auntie Mame crossed with Isadora Duncan and Alice Kramden. But the character never works. There\u2019s a scene where some construction workers are making rude remarks to a woman on a sidewalk below. Bancroft rides the elevator to the top of the building under construction, and shames the big, macho men into admitting they were wrong. The description makes the scene sound like an inspiration, but it goes wrong. It loses all its energy and turns into a speech by a neurotic scold.\n\nRon Silver is no better as the son. He tries everything to find Garbo \u2013 and the movie bogs down hopelessly while he\u2019s searching. He disguises himself as a delivery boy, he walks the beach outside her summer home, he coaxes inside in\u00adformation out of paparazzi. With a buildup like this, Garbo\u2019s entrance had better be spectacular. Unfortu\u00adnately, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s such an anticli\u00admax that it would have been more effective for the woman to die with\u00adout ever meeting Garbo.\n\nAs for the title: If Garbo talked in her movies as much as she talked in this one, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone who still wanted to talk with her.", "running_time": 103, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 1984, "date_published": "1984-10-12", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "title": "Garbo Talks (1984)"}
