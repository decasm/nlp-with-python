{"url": "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/thieves-like-us-1974", "by": "Keith Carradineas Bowie", "star_rating": 3.5, "text": "Like so much of his work, Robert Altman\u2019s \u201cThieves Like Us\u201d has to be approached with a certain amount of imagination. Some movies are content to offer us escapist experiences and hope we\u2019ll be satisfied. But you can\u2019t sink back and simply absorb an Altman film; he\u2019s as concerned with style as subject, and his preoccupation isn\u2019t with story or character, but with how he\u2019s showing us his tale. \n\nThat\u2019s the case with \u201cThieves Like Us,\u201d which no doubt has all sorts of weaknesses in character and plot, but which manages a visual strategy so perfectly controlled that we get an uncanny feel for this time and this place. The movie is about a gang of fairly dumb bank robbers, and about how the youngest of them falls in love with a girl, and about how they stick up some banks and listen to the radio and drink Coke and eventually get shot at.\n\nThe outline suggests \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d but \u201cThieves Like Us\u201d resembles it only in the most general terms of period and setting. The characters are totally different; \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d were anti-heroes, but this gang of Altman\u2019s has no heroism at all. Just a kindof plodding simplicity, punctuated by some of them with violence, and by the boy with a kind of wondering love. They play out their sad little destinies against two backdrops: One is the pastoral feeling of the Southern countryside, and the other is an exactly observed series of interior scenes that recapture just what it was like to drowse through a slow, hot summer Sunday afternoon, with the radio in the background and the kids playing at pretending to do Daddy\u2019s job. If Daddy is a bank robber, so what?\n\nThe radio is constantly on in the background of \u201cThieves Like Us,\u201d but it\u2019s not used as a source of music as it was in \u201cAmerican Graffiti\u201d or \u201cMean Streets.\u201d The old shows we hear are not supposed to be heard by Altman\u2019s characters; they\u2019re like theme music, to be repeated in the film when the same situations occur. \u201cGangbusters\u201d plays when they rob a bank, for example, even though the bank would have been closed before \u201cGangbusters\u201d came on. That\u2019s OK, because the radio isn\u2019t supposed to be realistic; it\u2019s Altman\u2019s wry, elegiac comment on the distance between radio fantasy and this dusty, slow-witted reality.\n\nAt the heart of the movie is a lovely relationship between the young couple, played by Keith Carradine and Shelley Duvall. They\u2019ve both been in Altman movies before (just about everybody in view here is in his stock company), and it\u2019s easy to see why he likes them so. They don\u2019t look like movie stars. They share a kind of rangy grace, an ability to project shyness and uncertainty. There\u2019s a scene in bed that captures this; it\u2019s a two-shot with Keith in the foreground and Shelley, on her back, eyes to the ceiling, slowly exhaling little plumes of smoke. Nothing is said. The radio plays. Somehow we know just how this quiet, warm moment feels.\n\nThe movie\u2019s fault is that Altman, having found the perfect means for realizing his story visually, did not spend enough thought, perhaps, on the story itself. \u201cThieves Like Us\u201d is not another \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d and yet it does end in a similar way, with a shoot-out. And by this time, we\u2019ve seen too many movies that have borrowed that structure; that have counted on the bloody conclusion to lend significance to what went before. In \u201cThieves Like Us,\u201d there just wasn\u2019t that much significance, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s meant to be. These are small people in a weary time, robbing banks because that\u2019s their occupation, getting shot because that\u2019s the law\u2019s occupation.\n\nAltman\u2019s comment on the people and time is carried out through the way he observes them; if you try to understand his intention by analyzing the story, you won\u2019t get far. Audiences have always been so plot-oriented that it\u2019s possible they\u2019ll just go ahead and think this is a bad movie, without pausing to reflect on its scene after scene of poignant observation. Altman may not tell a story better than any one, but he sees one with great clarity and tenderness.", "running_time": 123, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1974, "date_published": "1974-01-01", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Romance"], "title": "Thieves Like Us (1974)"}
