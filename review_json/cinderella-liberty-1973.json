From a point about 30 minutes into the film\u00d1when the situation of the characters has been made clear\u00d1there\u2019s no way I can believe these people would do these things in this way. And then the film\u2019s ending is such an improbable fantasy that I left feeling cheated; my emotions had been engaged but not respected.\n\nThe story. which just about depletes the national hearts-of-gold reserve. involves a sailor. a prostitute. her son born out of wedlock and the sailor\u2019s best buddy and most hated enemy (who are one and the same). The sailor. played by James Caan. is at liberty in Seattle with no sailing orders and no money because the Navy has lost his papers. The hooker. Marsha Mason is the best pool-player in town but has nothing in her icebox. if memory serves. but a bottle of lemon juice. Her son has a black father he\u2019s never met and is a street-wise 9-year-old who\u2019s taken a lot of bruises. And the best buddy. etc.. has finally been drummed out of the Navy for drunkenness. Years before. he once made Caan guard a garbage can in zero weather on Christmas.\n\nGiven these story elements. and knowing what we do about sailors and whores in the movies. it is. I suppose. almost inevitable that the sailor should get to like the girl and then really like the kid. That his protective instinct should suggest that it was really time he settle down. That a marriage would make good sense because then the girl and her kid could draw Navy benefits and the kid could get his teeth fixed. And that the old buddy could\u00d1but I guess I shouldn\u2019t give the ending away. no matter how many different reasons there are why it\u2019s impossible.\n\nThe material here is serious enough. drawing as it does on relationships between people living on the edge. but the situations keep turning out to be archetypal. We don\u2019t get the feeling of human beings learning about each other and trying to cope; we see people acting the way they\u2019re supposed to in terms of all the fictional cliches about characters in their position.\n\nThat makes things hard on the actors. who rise to the challenge with spirit\u00d1no matter that they\u2019re doomed. Marsha Mason. as the prostitute. is able to make us see the almost paralyzing feelings of inadequacy beneath her character\u2019s spunky surface. Kirk Calloway. as her son. is mercifully free of the cuteness and self-consciousness of so many child actors; he\u2019s tough and suspicious and hostile when he needs to be. James Caan is all right as the sailor. although too inclined to hem and haw and wallow in sincere inarticulateness. Eli Wallach. as old Forshay. the Navy veteran. overacts. I suppose. but then how can you bring subtlety to a part-time job as a tout for a strip show?\n\nThe movie wants us to take these people and their situation seriously. but it keeps finding Norman Rockwell solutions to its problems. It suggests complexities and then never resolves them. It never surprises us with truth.\n\nThere\u2019s an ancient theatrical rule that you don\u2019t bring a gun onstage in the first act unless it\u2019s going to be fired in the third. \u201cCinderella Liberty\u201d brings on a baby. so that it can die; has the boy say that nothing will ever make him cry. so that he can cry; loses the sailor\u2019s papers. so that they can be found; gives the boy cavities. so that they can be filled; drums the veteran out of the Navy. so that he can get back in. You can almost watch the first hour of the movie to learn all the problems. and then leave. knowing that they will be solved in the second hour.
