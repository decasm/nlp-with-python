The zame one I would haf chozun. In zah event of fire, he could grab zah eggstinguisher and zave all of zah roar-phans.\u201d The accent belongs to Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has long had a gift of comedy, but has seldom had a comedy to exercise it in. In \u201cTwins,\u201d teamed up in several different ways with Danny DeVito, he gets the movie off to a funny start. The movie begins with Schwarzenegger as the unpaid assistant of a scientist who lives on an island somewhere between Bora Bora and Australia.\n\nDiscovering that he has a twin brother he has never known about, Schwarzenegger commandeers an inflatable dinghy and starts rowing for the nearest airport.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the states, DeVito is in trouble. He\u2019s a professional con man who also does amateur cons in his spare time. His side line is stealing luxury cars at the airport and selling them to chop shops, and about the time Schwarzenegger is arriving in America, DeVito is thrown into jail for hundreds of dollars of unpaid parking tickets. Schwarzenegger tracks him down in a jail cell and tells him of their secret past. The diminutive DeVito, of course, does not believe this muscular Teuton is his twin. Few would.\n\nBut if Schwarzenegger has bail money, DeVito is prepared to play along with him.\n\nGood comedies often have central ideals that are transparently simple. \u201cTwins\u201d is an example. There are giant billboards all over the United States right now, showing DeVito\u2019s picture with the block letters \u201cSchwarzenegger\u201d underneath, and vice versa. It\u2019s a brilliant sell, and a clever idea, but the reason it works so well in the movie is that both Schwarzenegger and DeVito have genuinely tender sides to their natures. You know the movie is a running gag, but somehow there\u2019s a sweetness in their relationship that makes the plot seem less manipulated.\n\nThe explanation for their twinship is that both men were the result of a eugenics experiment in which the sperm from six different fathers was combined into a kind of natal milkshake and administered to their mother. The men represented brains, brawn and other attributes, and the woman was as nearly perfect as possible. But the experiment misfired and produced, not one perfect baby, but twins.\n\n\u201cYour brother got all of the good stuff,\u201d DeVito is told years afterward, when he finally confronts the mastermind behind the bizarre experiment. \u201cYou got the leftovers.\u201d That\u2019s why Schwarzenegger is an awesome physical specimen who speaks six languages and is a brilliant scientist and DeVito is a small-time hustler who manages to steal the wrong cars - for example, a late-model Cadillac that just happens to have a trunk containing industrial contraband worth millions.\n\nWhen I saw the plot turning toward the contraband, I began to grow apprehensive. And when the movie introduced a murderous industrial spy, my heart sank. I thought I could foresee yet another Hollywood movie in which the third act was jettisoned in favor of a shoot-out and a chase.\n\nHowever, director Ivan Reitman soft-pedals the subplot involving the stolen goods and actually manages to supply the movie with a real ending involving thought, dialogue and other elements that recently have tended to disappear in the last 25 minutes of Hollywood entertainments.\n\nThe movie supplies both men with love interests: DeVito with a long-suffering girlfriend (Chloe Webb, from \u201cSid and Nancy\u201d) and Schwarzenegger with Kelly Preston, who plays a hilarious love scene with him on the floor of a motel room. Why the floor? Because that\u2019s where Schwarzenegger prefers to sleep. The movie claims the Schwarzenegger character is a virgin, and there is a certain justification for that: The filmmakers claim this is actually Schwarzenegger\u2019s first love scene in 14 years of stardom.\n\nSchwarzenegger\u2019s gift for comedy was apparent in his very first film, the documentary \u201cPumping Iron\u201d (1974), and in his first feature, Bob Rafelson\u2019s \u201cStay Hungry,\u201d a year later. But it has had precious little use since then in a series of high-voltage action pictures, even though Schwarzenegger always finds a way to introduce comic dialogue or some sort of self-deprecating humor even in the most violent films.\n\nThis time, given comedy from beginning to end, he handles it with ease.\n\nDeVito\u2019s performance is equally assured, but less surprising, since we already knew he could cover this ground.\n\n\u201cTwins\u201d is not a great comedy - it\u2019s not up there with Reitman\u2019s \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and DeVito is not as funny as he was in \u201cRuthless People\u201d and \u201cWise Guys\u201d - but it is an engaging entertainment with some big laughs and a sort of warm goofiness.", "running_time": 107, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-12-09", "genres": ["Comedy"], "title": "Twins (1988)"}
