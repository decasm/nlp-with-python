First we get a Jamaican version of the standard black exploitation movie, with guns and gangsters and a flashy superhero turned folk hero. But the second movie--the one that makes the experience worthwhile\u00d1is a celebration of Jamaican music and style. This was the first extensive American movie exposure for reggae, the insinuating Jamaican music that was just then beginning to make itself heard over omnipresent rock.\n\nThe movie was a sleeper when it was shown at the 1972 Venice Film Festival, the first film made in Jamaica by Jamaicans, and no established channels existed to market it. Seeking exposure, the filmmakers rented a little theater in Venice proper and tried to lure festival-goers over from the Lido. The few who went came back with enthusiasm, and within a few days, the movie had become an underground hit. Good reviews at Venice eventually found it a distributor with Roger Corman\u2019s New World Films.\n\nThe movie is fun, but it\u2019s not as good as it seemed at Venice. Maybe that\u2019s because, at Venice, its brash irreverence and direct energy came as a relief after such turgid exercises as Ken Russell\u2019s \u201cSavage Messiah.\u201d Some movies work like that, winning audiences with rough humor and easy charm and forgetting the subtleties. \u2018sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song\u201d was one.\n\n\u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d stars Jimmy Cliff, who is a Jamaican pop star, and parts of it seem to have been drawn from his own early experiences. They\u2019re the best part; we meet a young, unsophisticated character who comes to the city and gets taken. Before long, he\u2019s taking in turn. The movie was filmed on bustling locations and overflows with the street life of Jamaica. And the early scenes have an unrehearsed documentary quality to them.\n\nBut then the filmmakers seem to have been overcome by their memories of American black exploitation movies. Cliff laboriously wins a recording contract and cuts the movie\u2019s title song, but the record isn\u2019t released because the industry\u2019s kingpin doesn\u2019t think Cliff can be controlled. And then, implausibly, Cliff turns to a life of crime. He starts slowly, but after he kills several policemen (for totally stupid reasons, I thought) he becomes a hero of the people. He goes on the run. He\u2019s everywhere, but nowhere. Everybody sees him but the police. And his record goes to the top of the charts.\n\nThe movie ends in a sort of \u201cDuel in the Sun\u201d showdown that leaves us unsatisfied. Somehow, the opening 45 minutes had prepared us for more. The tender early love scenes, for example, between Cliff and his shy girl friend (Janet Bartley), don\u2019t fit the cynicism of the last hour. The characters aren\u2019t consistent, and Cliff eventually becomes so unbelievable that we just stop caring. The movie\u2019s ending is an exercise in plot; its beginning and its music deserve better than that.", "running_time": 98, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-02-09", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama", "Foreign"], "title": "The Harder They Come (1973)"}
