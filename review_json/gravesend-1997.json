Since he has shown us not one single thing to be proud of, I can only assume he\u2019s setting us up for the sequel. The movie\u2019s characters are stupid and brutish, and spend their nights getting into fights every 15 minutes, possibly because they can think of nothing else to do.\n\nGravesend, we learn, is a Brooklyn neighborhood, little known because its residents \u201cusually claim to be from Bensonhurst or Coney Island.\u201d I have no doubt that many of its streets and people are delightful, but such delights have been denied us by the writer-director of the film, Salvatore Stabile, who wants to share a memory of the night that four of his buddies somehow wound up with three bodies in the trunk of their car, and that was only for starters.\n\nThere are possibilities for humor here, and rich characters. I am reminded of movies such as \u201cNew Jersey Drive,\u201d \u201cStraight Out of Brooklyn,\u201d \u201cSpike of Bensonhurst\u201d and \u201cTrue Love.\u201d But the lives of these four friends are lived at a monotonous level; they lack the words and perhaps the concepts for pastimes more challenging than drinking, smoking dope, holding aimless arguments and getting into meaningless fights. Even this material could be made amusing, but not here, where the characters seem to circle in loops of their own devising.\n\nAnd yet there are good things to be said about \u201cGravesend,\u201d and the most astonishing is that it was made for a reported $5,000, which is $3,000 less than Robert Rodriguez spent on \u201cEl Mariachi,\u201d the previous yardstick for inexpensive independent films. Stabile made the film when he was 19, found backers to put up post-production cash, and impressed so many people with his raw talent that \u201cGravesend\u201d is \u201cAn Oliver Stone Presentation\u201d and the director, now 22, has two projects under contract with Steven Spielberg\n\nStabile probably has good films in him. \u201cGravesend,\u201d made with limited resources, shows that. It also gives hints of the ways he\u2019ll be able to find humor in tough characters. The most entertaining performance in the movie is by Macky Aquilino as JoJo the junkie, a janitor and drug dealer whom the four friends ask for a favor: They need to dispose of a body. His price, after negotiation: \u201c$500 and a thumb.\u201d Cars with bodies in their trunks tend to attract trouble in the movies, and Stabile has fun with a tow truck operator and a cop, who both want to get their hands on the car. He also writes in a lot of unsuccessful Tarantino-esque dialogue, including arguments about math problems and lottery odds, and whether Walter Cronkite or Hugh Downs is the host of \u201c20/20.\u201d There are flashes of life here, a feeling of immediacy in the camera style, a lot of energy--and promise. But it\u2019s not yet the movie he\u2019s probably capable of; I have a feeling anyone with the wit to make a movie for $5,000 can write characters more worth knowing than these", "running_time": 85, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1997, "date_published": "1997-09-26", "genres": ["Thriller"], "title": "Gravesend (1997)"}
