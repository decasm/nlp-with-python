The death trip that went on inside Hitler\u2019s Berlin bunker has a grisly fascination of its own, but this movie doesn\u2019t get inside the characters; it isn\u2019t demented enough, somehow. If poor Visconti hadn\u2019t entirely wigged out with \u201cThe Damned,\u201d he might have been the right director for this assignment.\n\nAs it is, we get a fashion show (heavy on the red lipstick, please) and a lot of secondhand historical gossip. Hitler and Eva Braun, it appears, spent their last days together in much the same manner as Bonnie and Clyde. They listened to records, got tender and were just on the blink of - at last! - consummating their mutual romantic fantasies when the Russians and/or Texas Rangers had to spoil everything. \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d at least had the grace to give us a moment of silence after the shooting, so that the fact of death could sink in.\n\n\u201cHitler\u201d has an incredibly off-key ending (the tone is wrong, even if it\u2019s historically accurate; movies have artistic license to lie, if necessary). Hitler never allowed anyone to smoke, you see, and so the first thing everyone does when they learn he\u2019s dead is . . . light up.\n\nThe facts in the movie have been certified as accurate by no less than Hugh Trevor-Roper, who, it is said, should know. I have a rule of thumb about historical movies, and it\u2019s this: Always beware if the producer starts telling you how accurate his facts are. Accuracy is almost always a cop-out in these matters; It means the director and the writers have failed to find an artistically satisfying point of view toward their material. Facts mean nothing compared to truth. And truth, as always, is as elusive as artistry.\n\nThis movie resolutely stays outside its characters. Alec Guinness plays Hitler as if they had both been strongly influenced by Chaplin\u2019s \u201cThe Great Dictator.\u201d We get the tantrums, the interminable self-praise, the megalomania. Hitler was probably like this, we suppose, but isn\u2019t there a way to arrange this material so we don\u2019t get as bored with him as his senior staff did? There\u2019s always a problem, as in the case of an extreme personality like Hitler, that a movie will slip over that thin line into comedy. We know what a catastrophe Hitler was to Western civilization, but somehow this isn\u2019t Hitler, it\u2019s Guinness with a moustache, and it\u2019s hard to remember the movie isn\u2019t a parody. \u201cSpringtime for Hitler,\u201d from \u201cThe Producers,\u201d keeps sneaking in. That happens, for example, in an awkward-funny scene where a city councilman is brought in to marry the loving couple. The councilman, collecting answers for his official marriage license form, asks Hitler: \u201cAre you ... Aryan?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no tragedy in this movie, no sense of the vast scale of suffering outside the bunker. The director does periodically cut to grainy newsreel footage of death and destruction, but this real footage does the opposite of what he expects: Instead of lending credibility to his story, it sabotages it. Guinness and his supporting cast simply cannot stand up to actual World War II footage. The movie becomes an embarrassed fiction.\n\nAn example. The movie uses the famous photo of Jews being rounded up in the Warsaw Ghetto. In the foreground there is a little boy, 8 or 9 years old, his hands raised and terror on his face. This photo is one of the most heartbreaking reminders of man\u2019s inhumanity in existence; it belongs with Piccasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica.\u201d Ingmar Bergman used the same photo in \u201cPersona\u201d (along with the notorious TV footage of the street execution of a suspected Viet Cong) to help indicate the moral turmoil within his central character. But the thing was, Bergman understood that turmoil; had created it; knew why he was using such an emotionally charged image and knew how to direct it. In \u201cHitler: The Last Ten Days,\u201d the photo (and, indeed, the entire war) are simply exploited for whatever fringe benefits can be extracted. That\u2019s obscene. The movie itself, however, isn\u2019t good enough to be obscene: It\u2019s merely unnecessary.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-05-22", "genres": ["Drama", "Foreign", "History", "Science Fiction", "Thriller", "War"], "title": "Hitler: The Last Ten Days (1973)"}
