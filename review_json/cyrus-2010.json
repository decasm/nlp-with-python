Reillyas John", "star_rating": 3.5, "text": "Marisa Tomei plays warm and friendly as well as anyone, and those qualities are essential to \u201cCyrus,\u201d a film about her grown son and her new boyfriend waging what amounts to war over the possession of her body. There\u2019s no incest, but a photo in her bedroom suggests the son was still getting to second base well into his adolescence. The boyfriend is pathetically happy to get on base at all, and this creates a comedy of awkwardness, private thoughts, passive aggression and veiled hostility. All Molly (Tomei) wants is for everybody to like one another and get along.\n\nHer boyfriend John (John C. Reilly) is fine with that goal, but her son Cyrus (Jonah Hill) is jealous and possessive, and very intelligent about how to use his feelings in a sneaky way so it\u2019s not always obvious what he\u2019s up to. Not obvious to Molly, anyway, because she doesn\u2019t really want to know. More obvious to John, who\u2019s on such thin ice he\u2019s slow to admit how unpleasant the situation has become.\n\nI can imagine how a sex comedy could spring from this premise or even an oedipal drama. What\u2019s intriguing about \u201cCyrus\u201d is that way it sort of sits back and observes an emotional train wreck as it develops. The movie doesn\u2019t eagerly jump from one payoff to another, but attunes itself to nuance, body language and the habitual politeness with which we try to overlook social embarrassment. With only three people, however, it\u2019s a problem when one is deliberately creating embarrassment.\n\nJonah Hill, who is a fairly large man, is able to morph himself somehow into a big baby here; he cleverly uses immature conduct to excuse inappropriate behavior. When he hugs his mommy, for example, there\u2019s the not-so-slight suggestion that he does so not as her son but as her smoocher. There\u2019s no suggestion that actual sex has ever been involved, but to poor John (and to us), he\u2019s over the top. Molly seems oblivious.\n\nCyrus pretends to welcome and like John. His very welcome outreaches the bounds of propriety. Then little things happen. John\u2019s shoes disappear. If Cyrus took them, he could easily throw them away. But \u201cwhoever\u201d took them, they\u2019re left where they will eventually be found, a ticking time bomb. Little things like that.\n\nMarisa Tomei has the trickiest role here. She\u2019s lonely, she\u2019s been single too long, and she likes John, the big lug. She befriends him at a party where he\u2019s desperately unhappy. She discovers him peeing in the shrubbery and says what, under these circumstances, is a remarkably tactful thing to relieve the embarrassment: \u201cnice penis.\u201d He needs a woman like this. He\u2019s apart from his first wife (Catherine Keener), who was maybe too smart for him. Molly isn\u2019t dumb, but she\u2019s \u2014 well, sometimes she\u2019s improbably clueless. She is also very sexy, so you can understand that a boy the age of Cyrus (but not her son) would be attracted. That avoids possible eww moments.\n\n\u201cCyrus\u201d was written and directed by the Duplass brothers, Mark and Jay, who up until now have been identified with \u201cmumblecore\u201d \u2014 a movement, a term I hope I never have to use again. Let\u2019s put it this way: If a movie is mumblecore, it probably doesn\u2019t much want to be enjoyed, and if it isn\u2019t, why call it failed mumblecore? Their previous film, \u201cBaghead\u201d (2008), was not beloved by me. Now here is a film that uses very good actors and gives them a lot of improvisational freedom to talk their way into, around and out of social discomfort. And it\u2019s not snarky. It doesn\u2019t mock these characters. It understand they have their difficulties and hopes they find a way to work things out. There\u2019s your suspense: How can they?", "running_time": 91, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 2010, "date_published": "2010-06-23", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Horror", "Romance"], "title": "Cyrus (2010)"}
