Clark, as part of the Midwest Independent Film Festival. Thunder herself and director Greg Kohs will appear in person.\n\n\"Song Sung Blue\" tells a love story about two people who are apart only three days after 1989, who love each other in good times and in bad, and whose romance blossoms in shabby bars, smoky clubs and, once, in front of 30,000 people. Their names are Mike and Claire Sardina. If you're from Milwaukee, you oughta know them. They performed under the name \"Lightning & Thunder,\" and were famous enough locally that they sold out their bookings. When they had troubles it made every local TV news show. And they had troubles. Who else do you know who had two out-of-control cars run into their house in four years?", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": "No", "release_year": 2008, "date_published": "2009-02-11", "genres": null, "title": "Song Sung Blue (2008)"}
