People look at you and make a judgment call, and then, try as you might, you\u2019re only spinning your wheels.\n\nThat\u2019s how Tess McGill feels in the opening scenes of \u201cWorking Girl.\u201d She is intelligent and aggressive, and she has a lot of good ideas about how to make money in the big leagues of high finance. But she is a secretary. A secretary with too much hair. A secretary who rides the Staten Island ferry to work. A secretary who started talking like a little girl because it was cute when she was 11, and is still talking the same way, except now she is 30. There is no way anybody is ever going to take her seriously.\n\nOne day Tess (Melanie Griffith) gets a new job and a new boss in the mergers and acquisitions department of a Wall Street firm. The boss (Sigourney Weaver) is a woman of almost exactly Tess\u2019s age, but with a different set of accessories. For example, she talks in a low, modulated voice, and wears more businesslike clothes, and has serious hair. \u201cIf you want to get ahead in business,\u201d Tess muses, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have serious hair.\u201d Tess gets along fine with her boss until the boss goes on a skiing holiday and breaks her leg and is supposed to be in traction for six weeks. Then Tess accidentally sees a file in her boss\u2019s computer and finds that the boss was about to steal one of Tess\u2019s brilliant suggestions and claim it as her own.\n\nThis makes her fighting mad, and so she begins an elaborate deception in which she masquerades as an executive at the firm, and figures out a way to meet a guy named Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford), who is the right guy at another firm to make the deal happen. She meets Trainer at a party and gets drunk and ends up in bed with him, even though she explained to him, \u201cI have a head for business and a bod for sin.\u201d Will he ever take her seriously now? Yes, it turns out, because he likes her, and because he thinks her idea really is pretty brilliant.\n\nThat\u2019s the setup for \u201cWorking Girl,\u201d the new Mike Nichols film, which is one of those entertainments where you laugh a lot along the way, and then you end up on the edge of your seat at the end.\n\nStructurally, the film has some parallels with \u201cThe Graduate,\u201d Nichols\u2019 1967 classic - including a climactic scene where an important ceremony is interrupted by the wrong person bursting in through the door.\n\nBut \u201cWorking Girl\u201d is the other side of the coin. \u201cThe Graduate\u201d was about a young man who did not want to make money in plastics.\n\n\u201cWorking Girl\u201d is about a young woman who very definitely wants to make money in mergers.\n\nThis is Melanie Griffith\u2019s movie in the same way \u201cThe Graduate\u201d belonged to Dustin Hoffman. She was not an obvious casting choice, but she is the right one. And in an odd way, her two most famous previous roles, in \u201cBody Double\u201d and \u201cSomething Wild,\u201d work for her. Because we may remember her from those sex-drenched roles, there is a way in which both Griffith and her character are both trying to get respectable - to assimilate everything that goes along with \u201cserious hair.\u201d Supporting roles are crucial in movies like this. Weaver\u2019s role is a thankless one - she plays the pill who gets humiliated at the end - and yet it is an interesting assignment for an actor with Weaver\u2019s imagination. From her first frame on the screen, she has to say all the right things while subtly suggesting that she may not mean any of them.\n\nIf she is subtle, so is Ford, an actor whose steadiness goes along with a sort of ruminating passion. When he\u2019s in love with a woman, he doesn\u2019t grab her; he just seems to ponder her a lot. Weaver and Ford provide the indispensable frame within which the Griffith character can be seen to change.\n\nThe plot of \u201cWorking Girl\u201d is put together like clockwork. It carries you along while you\u2019re watching it, but reconstruct it later and you\u2019ll see the craftsmanship. Kevin Wade\u2019s screenplay is sort of underhanded in the way it diverts us with laughs, and with a melodramatic subplot involving Griffith\u2019s former boyfriend, while all the time it\u2019s winding up for the suspenseful climax.\n\nBy the time we get to the last scenes, the movie plays like a thriller, and that\u2019s all the more effective because we weren\u2019t exactly bracing for that.\n\n\u201cWorking Girl\u201d is Nichols returning to the top of his form, and Griffith finding hers.", "running_time": 116, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-12-21", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "title": "Working Girl (1988)"}
