Donaldson uses precise details of Hitler's takeover of Germany and plugs them into the New Zealand setting, and then he gives us a hero who wants to sit the fight out and is publicized by the government into being a symbol of opposition.\u00a0\n\nAmerican troops are sent in to help the New Zealanders put down the \"rebellion,\" and the rebels conduct a running guerilla battle against them. \n\nThe movie resembles \"Z\" and \"The Battle of Algiers\" in the way it combines ideology with fiercely-paced action. The biggest box-office hit of its time in New Zealand, it launched Donaldson's career. In 1982 he directed \"Smash Palace,\" with its strong performance by Bruno Lawrence in the story of a man who grows desperate when he loses custody of his daughter. Then he moved on to Hollywood, becoming a successful director of thrillers and adventure movies.", "running_time": 107, "mpaa_rating": "No", "release_year": 1977, "date_published": "1977-01-01", "genres": ["Action", "Foreign", "Thriller"], "title": "Sleeping Dogs (1977)"}
