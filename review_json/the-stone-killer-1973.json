That\u2019s what people go to movies like this for, and Winner (after betraying the shreds of artistic ambition in such earlier works as \u201cThe Jokers\u201d) directs it with great zeal.\n\nThe hero is Charles Bronson, who possibly does not have 750 words of dialog in the entire movie (he talks even less than Clint Eastwood). Bronson doesn\u2019t need the dialog. He acts with his body, which is muscular and catlike and strangely expansive; we never catch him just standing there. He always seems ready to pounce. \n\nThere\u2019s one scene where he\u2019s got a gunman cornered behind a door, and the gunman is shooting through the door. From a flat-footed standing start, Bronson simply leaps three feet up in the air to the top of a table, kicks open the door and nails the guy. To be sure, scenes like that don\u2019t win Academy Awards. But Bronson\u2019s sheer physicality makes the scene convincing; he\u2019s the most athletic of the current male superstars, and he\u2019s the one we\u2019d back in a fight. The movie\u2019s plot is totally preposterous. Bronson is on a trail of dead bodies that leads, ultimately, to a Mafia don (Martin Balsam). The don has hired a cadre of Vietnam veterans to stage an ambush that will wipe out the entire Italian mob leadership, thus gaining revenge for a series of assassinations of Sicilians on April 10, 1931. The long-delayed vengeance is just an excuse for this story; it gives some small measure of plausibility to a movie that\u2019s really about violence and chase scenes.\n\nOf which there is a beauty. Bronson, in a car, is after a killer on a motorcycle. Together they crash through a handicraft fair, jump railroad tracks, burst through warehouses and used-car dealerships, and raise hell in general. It\u2019s an exhilarating scene, magnificently choreographed, with a lot of difficult stunts well planned. And with Bronson at the wheel, you can relax; you know he\u2019s not going to stop for a little well-chosen dialog.", "running_time": 95, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-10-19", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Crime"], "title": "The Stone Killer (1973)"}
