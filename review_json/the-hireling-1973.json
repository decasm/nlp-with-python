She isn\u2019t one of those clever, strong British aristocrats loved so much by Henry James - the ones who were always arranging marriages and going off to Florence for the winter. No, she\u2019s a pale and quiet little thing without a bit of self-confidence. We meet her just as she\u2019s released from a convalescent home. She had a bit of a breakdown after the death of her first husband, who was the Conservative Member of Parliament for the district. She herself doesn\u2019t know or understand the district much; she thinks sometimes that she should make more of an effort, but.... Waiting to deliver her home is a chauffeur, Leadbetter, whom her mother has hired. He is the soul of discretion and, like many other fictional British servants, perhaps more impressed by the upper classes than he should be. He calls her \u201cyour ladyship\u201d at the end of every sentence, and sometimes stops right in the middle of a sentence for an extra \u201cladyship\u201d or two.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t much like that. In a weary and listless sort of way, she\u2019s looking for company, not a chauffeur. She hires him to drive her on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and sits in the front seat with him. Once she even dozes (or was she really dozing?) and lets her head slip over to his shoulder.\n\nHe falls, of course, somewhat opportunistically in love - as who would not with Sarah Miles? This is an entirely different role for her than the gutsy frontier woman of \u201cThe Man Who Loved Cat Dancing,\u201d but she does a good job with it. And she has the excellent Robert Shaw to play against, as Leadbetter. Together they make the movie seem better than it probably is.\n\nBetter, because they inhabit their characters with enough life to make us believe an essentially cliched situation. The British movie about class antagonism had some of its finest moments about 10 years ago, but it wore out its welcome along the way. The endings began to seem too much the same (and the ending of \u201cThe Hireling\u201d doesn\u2019t show much imagination - what happens is what we think will happen, with a little self-destructive violence thrown in not very convincingly.) My favorite class-warfare movie was \u201cThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,\u201d with Tom Courtenay so magnificent as the borstal boy. He hated the young boys\u2019 prison, but he was the fastest runner on the cross-country team, and it meant a lot to the (upper-class) warden that his lads beat the public-school boys. At the end of the film, Courtenay is way out in front of the pack when he stops running. Just stops. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, guv\u2019nor. That particular movie was made from a novel by Alan Sillitoe, who hated the British class system with a force no doubt inspired by experience. \u201cThe Hireling\u201d (and another movie about class, \u201cThe Go-Between\u201d), was based on a novel by L. P. Hartley, who doesn\u2019t seem to have the same sympathy for the working class. His chauffeur is earnest enough, we feel, but the poor fellow simply doesn\u2019t have enough style to go around thinking he\u2019d be interesting to a lady - don\u2019t you see?\n\nThere\u2019s a nice supporting performance by Peter Egan, who plays the local Liberal candidate and smoothly woos Lady Franklin right out from under Leadbetter (while also carrying on with Leadbetter\u2019s sometime mistress - has he no charity?). And the principals are good, and the direction by Alan Bridges is especially good, particularly when he develops the tentative original relationship. But the movie is too sure of where it\u2019s going to leave us with any curiosity. It shared the grand award at Cannes this year with \u201cScarecrow,\u201d by the way. They\u2019re both movies in which superior actors are counted on to carry weak stories.", "running_time": 108, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-07-25", "genres": ["Drama"], "title": "The Hireling (1973)"}
