Turning into spies, the trucker and the cook spied on her competitors to discover the secret of perfect noodles, while Itami intercut their adventures with brief scenes mercilessly satirizing Japanese customs and foibles.\n\n\u201cTampopo\u201d was his second movie. Before it he made \u201cThe Funeral,\u201d which scrutinized Japanese ways of death, and now he has made \u201cA Taxing Women,\u201d about the country\u2019s preoccupation with taxes and money.\n\nConsidering that sex is an undercurrent in all of his films, Itami has now made films about the four obsessions of modern life: death, food, money and eros.\n\n\u201cTampopo\u201d was a gem of a film, starring Nobuko Miyamoto, Itami\u2019s wife, as the would-be noodle mistress. \u201cA Taxing Women\u201d stars her once again, as a pleasant, low-key, relentless tax inspector who lives only to catch cheats at their schemes. Since Miyamoto apparently believes that all Japanese cheat on their taxes, she has an endless task, and she never considers herself off the job.\n\nConsider, for example, how she stumbles across the case that will transform her career. By accident, she happens into a Tokyo \u201clove hotel,\u201d a hot-pillow operation where the turnover seems so quick that she estimates every room must be occupied more than once a night. Yet she finds that the owner of the hotel, a gangster/investor named J\u00fbkichi Ishii, is reporting an income far below her estimates. So she launches a zealous one-woman campaign to bring him to justice.\n\n\u201cA Taxing Women\u201d is not really about her investigation, however. It is about the strange bond that grows up between these two people - the shy bureaucrat and the flamboyant gangster. They do not fall in love, not exactly. Instead, they begin to see in each other\u2019s eyes a respect for the same things: for cleverness, for the creation and solving of mysteries, and, especially, for money. The hotel owner begins to enjoy the tax inspector because she is perhaps the only person who is as interested in his financial manipulations as he is.\n\nAnd she begins to enjoy him because he has given her a bigger challenge than anybody else. Perhaps, however, \u201cenjoy\u201d is the wrong word; they play against each other like seasoned poker adversaries.\n\nAll of this should work like clockwork, and sometimes it does, but I found \u201cA Taxing Woman\u201d a disappointment after the lean economy of \u201cTampopo.\u201d The movie sometimes seems shapeless, overlong and meandering, and there are stretches when nothing much seems to happen.\n\nThe movie is less like an essay than like a series of disconnected observations. In approaching his subject from many angles, Itami fails to find the one that he needs.\n\nYet there are reasons to see the movie anyway, and one of them is its portrait of everyday Japanese life. There are ways in which modern Japanese society seems on the same track as American society, and other ways in which it seems totally impenetrable. The tax system in Japan will seem familiar to any American viewer, and so will the actions of the gangster and the \u201ctaxing woman.\u201d But I was baffled, and intrigued, by the ways that accounting procedures seemed to function as a metaphor for sexuality. I yearned for the simplicity of noodles.", "running_time": 127, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-06-24", "genres": null, "title": "A Taxing Woman (1988)"}
