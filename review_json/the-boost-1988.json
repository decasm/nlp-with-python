It is also about the hedonistic lifestyles of the 1980s, especially in go-go areas like the Los Angeles real estate market in which fortunes are won and squandered in a matter of months and there is unspeakable pressure to keep up appearances. The movie is a modern-day version of \u201cDeath of a Salesman,\u201d with James Woods selling leveraged tax shelters. He\u2019s out there on a smile, a shoeshine and a line of cocaine.\n\nWoods is one of the most intense, unpredictable actors in the movies today. You watch his characters because they seem capable of exploding - not out of anger, but out of hurt, shame and low self-esteem. They\u2019re wounded, but they fight back by being smarter than anyone else and using jokes and sarcasm to keep people at arm\u2019s length.\n\nThat\u2019s the case with Lenny, the guy he plays in this movie. He doesn\u2019t care if you like him or not, just so long as you see that he has a big house, an expensive car and a wife so beautiful that - in his words - \u201cHow did she wind up with a runt like me?\u201d As the movie opens, Lenny is calling names in the phone book to peddle some kind of half-baked \u201cinvestment opportunity.\u201d He meets a pleasant enough young prospect, invites him to dinner and then explodes halfway through the meal, all of his resentments pouring out. Lenny hurts. But one day he meets a kind, philosophical older man (Steven Hill) who hires him to come out to L.A. and sell tax shelters to people with windfall profits.\n\nLenny is an overnight success. All he needed was the veneer of respectability - the expensive suits, the Mercedes - to cover his desperation. He\u2019s flying high. When he decides to invest in some cockamamie Mexican nightclub, his wife, Linda (Sean Young), cautions him that they are overextended. He doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s rich and the money is pouring in and he\u2019s invincible, and then Congress changes the tax laws and his business evaporates overnight.\n\nIt\u2019s at that point that he tries cocaine for the first time.\n\nHe\u2019s given his first taste by a free-spending friend (John Kapelos) who owns a chain of car washes. He likes it. It puts him back on top of the world. And as Lenny and Linda hit the skids, they\u2019re looking up all the way down. Cocaine makes their failures seem like temporary setbacks in a master plan. It makes them feel great. They never figure out the answer to George Carlin\u2019s famous question: \u201cWhat does cocaine feel like? It makes you feel like more cocaine.\u201d As Lenny and Linda head for the bottom, the movie turns into one of the most convincing and horrifying portraits of drug addiction I\u2019ve ever seen. The director, Harold Becker, has directed Woods in two of his best movies (\u201cThe Onion Field\u201d and \u201cThe Black Marble\u201d). In this even darker story, he never insists too much; he simply observes. Lenny and Linda lose their expensive house. They move out of their middle-class high-rise apartment. They spend some time working in a health-food store on the beach, trying to go straight and dry out.\n\nLenny attends some kind of a rehabilitation program (offscreen), and comes back temporarily sober, but he\u2019s walking a tightrope.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the problem,\u201d he says. \u201cLinda was only keeping me company.\u201d Linda thinks the same thing, and so when the car-wash king and his wife visit her at the beach, she tries a line of cocaine, gets stoned, falls down some stairs and has a miscarriage. And then they really hit the skids. The movie portrays with almost effortless conviction the world of apartments-by-the-week in the seamy neighborhoods of Hollywood, where everybody has two occupations - the one he hopes someday to work at, and dealing drugs. Lenny, who was born desperate, becomes completely strung out, disoriented, paranoid. And still he clings to the delusion that he\u2019ll be back on top someday, that drugs are somehow the answer.\n\nI received a letter the other day from a documentary filmmaker who is working on a TV program about mystical experiences. \u201cAlcoholism and drug addiction in the 20th century,\u201d he writes, \u201cmay be related to the human desire for transcendence.\u201d Yes, and in other centuries, too, but in a reverse sort of way: If you\u2019re a drunk or an addict, you\u2019ve got to transcend that before you can move along to other kinds of transcendence. Lenny\u2019s problem, in the closing scenes of \u201cThe Boost,\u201d is that every detail of his life is governed in one way or another by his need to drink or take drugs. He\u2019s not transcending. He\u2019s maintaining. All he can hope for is a miracle.", "running_time": 95, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-12-23", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "title": "The Boost (1988)"}
