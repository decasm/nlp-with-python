{"url": "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-night-visitor-1973", "by": "Max von Sydowas Salem", "star_rating": 2.0, "text": "We have seen Max von Sydow as the patriarch of a Hawaiian dynasty, and we\u2019ve seen him as a medieval farmer, and we\u2019ve even seen him as Jesus Christ, but until \u201cThe Night Visitor\u201d we have never seen him running through the snow in his underwear.\n\nWhy, you ask ... why is he running through the snow in his underwear? You\u2019ve heard about the loneliness of the long-distance runner, but this is ridiculous. Well, I\u2019d like to explain, but ... I hesitate. Whenever I review a thriller, I get complaints from thriller fans who say I gave away too much of the plot. I know how they feel.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t think we can leave Max out there in the cold, and so I will say only this much: He is running in his underwear through the snow because he has used the rest of his clothing to help make a rope so he can escape from the asylum and commit murders and pin them on his brother-in-law.\n\nWhy does he want to frame his brother-in-law? Simple. His brother-in-law framed HIM two years ago, after the mysterious ax-murder of a farm hand. And now Max is in an asylum for the criminally insane, where he plays chess and carves little statues of hands that look like claws. And he broods a lot. Brood, brood ... he\u2019s bent on revenge. \n\nHe\u2019s bent, all right. And his gimmick is that he\u2019s found a secret way to escape from the asylum, commit murder, and get back in again - so he has a perfect alibi. Also, he\u2019ll have a cold if he\u2019s not careful. It may occur to the careful reader that I have explained a lot more than just why Max von Sydow is jogging through the snow in his underwear. That\u2019s so; but don\u2019t think I\u2019ve given away the plot, or anything. The thing that makes \u201cThe Night Visitor\u201d less than thrilling is its compulsion to give away its own plot. Everything I\u2019ve described - and also the way he gets out of the asylum - is revealed by the movie long before its end.\n\nWell, if the movie doesn\u2019t depend on a surprise ending, then it must be a psychological thriller and depend on character development, right? If only that were so. Alas, the characters are not developed at all. They\u2019re all finished when we meet them, and they behave with perfect consistency right down to the end. The only spontaneous developments in the movie are thanks to the brother-in-law\u2019s parrot. There\u2019s a point about halfway through when you think maybe \u201cThe Night Visitor\u201d is depending on atmosphere and performances. Von Sydow is gaunt and foreboding (as they say in movies like this), and Liv Ullmann, as his sister, has perfected the one obligatory scene that\u2019s in every thriller: Dashing downstairs to make sure the doors are closed, and then hearing a noise upstairs, and dashing upstairs and desperately throwing open a door to reveal ... nothing.\n\nPer Oscarsson, as the brother-in-law, is a master of the rolling eyeball, and Trevor Howard plays the Police Inspector as if he\u2019d been playing police inspectors all his life, which he has. The movie\u2019s story is so obvious, however, that these good actors are left with not much to do. I would have appreciated a tennis match or something in the third reel. Or even a better view of Max von Sydow\u2019s chess game; it looked to me like he opened with a knight to rook three, which is the kind of innovation he never allowed himself in that game against Death in \u201cThe Seventh Seal.\u201d Of course, Death probably has a stare across the board that makes Bobby Fischer look chummy.", "running_time": 106, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-01-30", "genres": ["Thriller"], "title": "The Night Visitor (1973)"}
