You know the inhabitants by name, and quite a few of their faces. You even knew some of their secrets, and what they privately think of one another.\n\nYou know, for example, that this jolly appliance salesman was the famed \u201cColonel\u201d Gaspar, hero of the Resistance. That a local public relations man was so impressed by the Third Reich that he signed up with a company of French volunteers and went off to wear the German uniform and fight the Russians. And that a weathered old farmer who fought for the underground knows which of his neighbors turned him in to the Nazis, but doesn\u2019t much care.\n\n\u201cWhat can be done about it at this late date?\u201d he sighs, sitting at his kitchen table surrounded by his family, his friends and several bottles of the excellent regional wine.\n\nHis remark is one of the most haunting in the whole 4 1/2-hour length of this remarkable documentary, because he seems to be speaking for so many of the survivors of the Nazi occupation of France, on both sides. Their passions were high and their loyalties were fierce, and many of them were killed, tortured or imprisoned.\n\nAnd yet, 30 years later, they seem to share a kind of intellectual exhaustion on the subject.\n\nThe occupation was such a complex matter, so much a matter of human nature, they seem to say. It is hard to explain to an outsider (and maybe even to oneself) exactly how a decision was reached, and why some Frenchmen collaborated with the Germans while others resisted and most simply tried to carry on business as usual.\n\nDirector Marcel Ophuls spent more than two years compiling the 50 hours of footage that was eventually edited into \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity.\u201d He spoke with the little people - some of them so anonymous they seem ashamed of their opinions, if indeed they have any - and with the larger figures such as Pierre Mendes-France, Georges Bidault, Anthony Eden and the German armaments czar Albert Speer.\n\nHe introduces us to \u201cColonel\u201d Gaspar and also to Gaspar\u2019s wartime associate who says a little bitchily that Gaspar was a hero, yes, but he was greedy for glory.\n\nOphuls has also found the commander of the German occupation forces in Clermont-Ferrand, and obtained a painfully revealing interview with him at his daughter\u2019s wedding. (He thinks others resent the fact that he wears his World War II decorations because they\u2019re jealous that they don\u2019t have medals of their own, and he complains that the Resistance fighters didn\u2019t play fair - they disguised themselves as peasants instead of wearing a mark of identification, \u201csome kind of hat or arm-band, you know\u201d).\n\nThe striking thing about all of these people is that, so far as I can remember, no one on either side brings up questions of morality in an attempt to explain his own actions. No one says that he acted as he did because he was right and the other side was wrong. This was certainly the basis for actions of many of the participants, but they seem reluctant to admit to such deep motivation.\n\nInstead, they give reasons that seem banal until you realize how moving their evasions actually are.\n\nThe old farmer, for example, went underground and risked his life for years because, he says, he grew tired of being told in restaurants that there was no meat: \u201cAnd here were the Germans eating all the meat they wanted, and it was our meat, too . . . French beef!\u201d\n\nOn the other side, the son of an anti-Semitic aristocratic family says he joined with the Germans \u201cbecause what else was someone of my class to do? There were two movements that could change the world, communism and fascism, and I couldn\u2019t be a Communist, obviously. Besides, we were all a little thrilled by Hitler\u2019s show; it was like Cecil B. DeMille.\u201d\n\nOphuls makes it clear that the majority of Frenchmen were neither supporters of the Germans nor members of the resistance. Instead, they went along rather quietly with the wartime collaborationist government of Petain and Laval.\n\nThe movie makes the point that France was the only nation that actually collaborated during the war and that de Gaulle\u2019s \u201cFree French\u201d in London were in the embarrassing position of not being a government-in-exile, because France\u2019s government remained in residence.\n\nThose who \u201cwent along\u201d did so, not because they were lacking in patriotism or moral backbone, but because it seemed the thing to do. Ophuls has pointed out in an interview that the establishment tends to remain the establishment, no matter what. To be in the resistance, he speculates, \u201cyou had to be a misfit, one who wouldn\u2019t go along,\u201d and this is a point the movie makes.\n\nEven de Gaulle was a misfit, his military career stalled until the war, who refused to accept a French government that looked (sadly) legal to the rest of the world.\n\nWhat \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity\u201d does more brilliantly than anything else is to avoid abstractions and give its human portraits of people who tried to land on their feet during chaotic times.\n\nThere are unforgettable scenes. Pierre Mendes-France recalls his prison break during the war. He was on top of the wall, ready to jump when he became aware that a young couple was romancing in the bushes below. \u201cHe knew what he wanted, but she was unsure,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHer indecision was very inconvenient for me.\u201d\n\nIt is left to Anthony Eden, whose own political career was destroyed by the Suez crisis, to add the wisest words in the movie, words that express directly and simply what Ophuls seems to be telling us: \u201cOne who has not suffered the horrors of an occupying power has no right to judge a nation that has.\u201d\n\nStill, there are heroes and villains in \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity,\u201d and a great number of people in between whom, we finally come to realize, probably acted not much differently than we might have. In its complexity, its humanity, its refusal to find easy solutions, this is one of the greatest documentaries ever made.", "running_time": 251, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1972, "date_published": "1972-09-19", "genres": ["Documentary", "History", "War"], "title": "The Sorrow and the Pity (1972)"}
