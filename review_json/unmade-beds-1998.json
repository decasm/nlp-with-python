One of those women would still be with me today if I was a faithful kind of a guy.\u201d Those are the four protagonists in Nicholas Barker's \u201cUnmade Beds,\u201d a film that walks and talks like a documentary but is, I am assured, entirely scripted. Barker found his subjects by answering 400 personal ads in New York and screening the advertisers until he had found four who projected humor, personality and bleak desperation.\n\nEarly in the film he shows an Edward Hopper painting of empty urban windows, and the scenes of his film are separated by telephoto shots of New York apartment windows, some empty, others filled by people living their lives or simply looking out at the street below.\n\nOne of them is Brenda Monte, a tough-talking woman who has often been told she has a great body, \u201cbut now they add those three little words, `for your age.' \u201c Her problem: \u201cMy income is $2,000 a month. My expenses are $3,000.\u201d All she is to her teenage daughter \u201cis a cash machine and a taxi.\u201d What she wants from a man is money.\n\nMikey Russo, the \u201cscreenwriter,\u201d has never sold a screenplay. His apartment, filled with erotic art, says one thing to women: They're there for sex. The medicine cabinet is stocked with all their needs, even toothbrushes. \u201cI'm not cheap. They get Oral-Bs.\u201d We sense he doesn't have many visitors. He has himself paged to get out of buying dinner.\n\nAimee has a nice smile and a warm laugh, but is overweight and desperate for a man. Her aunt recently called her and said she had checked with the whole family (\u201cand I'm sure she did\u201d), and the family would be \u201cOK\u201d if she decided to have a child out of wedlock. In other words, they've given up any hope she will ever get married.\n\nMichael De Stephano stands 5-4 and is sensitive about his height. He tells dates they can meet in a public place, and if they can't stand the sight of him, they can just walk away. He keeps talking about how everyone, even his parents, suspects he is gay.\n\nAll of these people use their real names in the movie. Whether we are seeing their real lives is a good question. This is not cinema verite; some scenes took 10 takes. \u201cThe movie contains a lot of truth,\u201d Barker told an audience at this year's Toronto Film Festival, \u201cbut precious little reality.\u201d A couple of the characters \u201ctell major lies.\u201d You know it's scripted anyway, because of two stylistic giveaways: The characters never stumble over words, and the camera continues unbroken dialogue passages while cutting from one angle to another. But, hey, Robert Flaherty scripted \u201cNanook of the North.\u201d There's more than one path to truth.\n\nThe movie has moments that seem absolutely authentic, as when Aimee tells her friend she has always had a weight problem and will always have a weight problem, and she needs a man who is comfortable with that.\n\nThere are other moments that feel scripted, as when Brenda says she shoplifts dog food, because \u201cthey're God's creatures--I shouldn't have to pay for it.\u201d Then again, maybe Brenda would say that. She's disarmingly direct, and the movie's best scene occurs when she conducts a guided critical tour of her body, dispassionately pointing out the parts that are holding up and the places that are starting to sag. I am not sure if I believe that she really gets married to an immigrant for cash, but I believe every word of her description of her bridal trousseau, including the price she actually paid for her $400 dress.\n\nAt the end of the film, I concluded that Brenda will be OK, and the other three characters are single because getting married is the only thing that interests them. That can scare away a first date. It's a bad sign when a girl tells you she has her own health plan, and a guy points out the fresh toothbrushes. You don't sense a lot of confidence there. We never meet the immigrant Brenda goes to marry, but I'll bet there'd be a movie in his story.", "running_time": 93, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 1998, "date_published": "1998-10-30", "genres": ["Comedy"], "title": "Unmade Beds (1998)"}
