On the beach at Malibu, he meets Sherry, 43, and they are strongly attracted to one another. \u201cI'd love to meet her,\u201d Irene says.\n\nSherry flies to Chicago, where Irene tells her, \u201cMy number one priority is to see Mark married.\u201d As she prepares a meal for them, Sherry observes, \u201cThis is very funny.\n\nThis is like a mother and son thing.\u201d Irene says quietly, \u201cActually, we're lovers.\u201d Cut to Sherry doing a very peculiar double-take. Exit Sherry. \u201cI didn't like her,\u201d Irene tells Mark. \u201cI didn't like anything about her. A face is a mask. If you marry the most beautiful girl in the world and she turns out to be a bitch and a nag, she is gonna look like the ugliest thing that was ever dug up.\u201d \u201cMe and My Matchmaker\u201d never quite says what conclusions it is discovering. We can draw our own. The movie is narrated by Wexler, who does not have a career ahead of him doing voice-overs; he sounds stilted, like he's reading. But he is the right person for this soundtrack, because he's arriving at insights about himself. Through Irene, he meets Terry, and likes her. They date, although Irene disapproves (\u201cShe came to me to find a Jewish man to marry\u201d). At one point Terry looks into Mark's camera and says, \u201cMaybe you're just doing this to meet women.\u201d \u201cAm I?\u201d Mark asks himself. \u201cThe documentary has turned into something else--or does Irene have something to do with it?\u201d She does. \u201cSomething strange has happened between us,\u201d Irene tells him. \u201cI felt a connection with you that first day we met.\u201d If he meets the right girl, \u201cWhen you get married, is she going to take my place?\u201d Watching the last 10 minutes of the film is like walking on eggshells.\n\nMark is obviously a hit-and-run specialist, who has spent his life on a perfectionist quest for the unattainable \u201cgoddess.\u201d Irene has seen all this before, and understands Mark. But does she understand herself? The film is amazing and touching in the way it allows people to reveal themselves on camera, to think aloud. After it's over, we stand back and review what happened. A man started to make a documentary about someone else, and ended making a documentary about himself. Irene turned into the filmmaker and Mark turned into the subject. And there is more. In the last moments of the film we are reminded that the heart is indeed a lonely hunter, and that the hunt never ends.", "running_time": 55, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 1996, "date_published": "1996-08-02", "genres": null, "title": "Me & My Matchmaker (1996)"}
