They\r\naren\u2019t married, but he\u2019s fathered two of her children. Now she\u2019s pregnant\r\nagain, and there isn\u2019t enough money for food as it is. Suzanne is 22. She makes\r\na friend of Pauline, the 17-year-old around the corner who everyone calls\r\n\u201cPomme,\u201d for \u201capple,\u201d maybe because of her round cheeks.\n\nPomme\r\nhelps Suzanne find the money for an abortion, and stands by her as a friend\r\nduring the ordeal. The two women draw closer as the photographer wraps his\r\ninsecurity around himself. One day, returning to the studio, they find he has\r\nhanged himself. So now Suzanne is left with two children, no lover, and an\r\nuncertain future.\n\nSo\r\nbegins Agnes Varda\u2019s \u201cOne Sings, the Other Doesn\u2019t,\u201d which, despite its grim\r\nbeginnings, goes on to become one of the most appealing films by a French director\r\nwhose best work has always found a balance between the heart and the mind.\r\nVarda works close to the human grain; she insists whenever possible on making\r\ndocumentaries between each of her feature films, so she can stay in touch with\r\nreality and not fall for the stylistic excesses of the big fiction films.\n\nThat\r\nrestraint isn\u2019t always evident in \u201cOne Sings, the Other Doesn\u2019t,\u201d which\r\ncontains about three or four songs too many for its subject matter to support.\r\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of the story, which is simplicity itself: After her\r\nlover\u2019s death, Suzanne goes with her children to live on her parents\u2019 farm in\r\nthe country, and Pomme\u2026 well, Pomme has adventures.\n\nShe\r\nbecomes a pop singer. She becomes a feminist, and forms a singing group\r\ndedicated to woman\u2019s liberation. She falls in love with an Iranian student, who\r\nseems one sort of person in France and quite another after she marries him and\r\nmoves back to Iran to have his child. At home, he\u2019s an unreconstructed\r\nchauvinist, insisting that his wife fill traditional roles. She can\u2019t see it,\r\nand they finally part, more or less friends, and she returns to France.\n\nIn\r\nthe meantime, the two women have somehow kept in touch through the years.\r\nSometimes they meet; more often it\u2019ll be by letter or postcard, Pomme checking\r\nin from some exotic spot and Suzanne (who eventually marries a doctor) replying\r\nwith news of the reassuring rhythms of life on the farm. Varda\u2019s title is a\r\nperfect one (and even more melodic in French: \u201cL\u2019une chante, l\u2019autre pas\u201d).\r\nHere we have them, she says: Two women, friends, and one sings and the other\r\ndoesn\u2019t, but they\u2019ll remain friends and sisters for all of their lives.\n\nThe\r\nmovie\u2019s final passages are among the best. Pomme comes with her child and\r\nfriends to spend some time on the farm, and so several generations are brought\r\ntogether as the two friends approach the middles of their lives. There\u2019s a\r\npicnic, and kids playing, and wine, and singing (but of too many songs), and\r\nwhat Varda\u2019s doing, in a sneaky way, is making her case for feminism in a lyric\r\nvoice instead of a preachy one.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 1977, "date_published": "1978-03-16", "genres": null, "title": "One Sings, the Other Doesn't (1977)"}
