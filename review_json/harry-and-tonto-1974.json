He was happy with his life in the city (apart from the four muggings so far this year) and content to talk to his old cronies and to his cat, Tonto. \n\nBut life without a home isn\u2019t easy. He goes for a while to live with his son on Long Island, where he\u2019s welcomed, sort of, into a household on the edge of insanity. One of his grandsons thinks the other one is crazy. The other won\u2019t respond because, you see, he has taken a vow of silence. Harry sizes up the situation, packs Tonto in a carrying case, and hits the road. \n\nThe road becomes a strange and wonderful place for Harry, mostly because of his own resilient personality. He\u2019s played by Art Carney as a man of calm philosophy, gentle humor, and an acceptance of the ways people can be. He is also not a man in a hurry. When he can\u2019t carry Tonto onto an airplane, he takes the bus. When the bus can\u2019t wait for Tonto to relieve himself, he buys a used car and picks up hitchhikers.\n\nOne of them is a young girl who becomes his friend. She talks of her life, and he talks of his, including his long-ago romance with a member of the Isadora Duncan troupe. The last he\u2019d heard of her, she was living in Peru, Indiana, as the wife of a pharmacist. The girl talks him into stopping in Indiana and looking the old woman up. And he does so, in a scene of rare warmth and tenderness. The woman, Jessie (played by Geraldine Fitzgerald), has a very shaky memory, but she does recall being a dancer, and in the calm of the recreation room at her nursing home, the old couple dances together one last time.\n\nAnd then Harry\u2019s back on the road to Chicago, where he has a daughter who runs a bookstore. He spends a few days with her, walking on the beach and talking things over. His silent grandson has broken his vow and flown to Chicago to try to talk the old man into coming back to New York. But, no, Harry doesn\u2019t think he will. (\u201cYou\u2019re talking now?\u201d he asks his grandson. \u201cGarbo speaks,\u201d the kid shrugs.)\n\nHe heads vaguely westward. His young hitchhiker has fallen in love with his grandson, and they think they\u2019ll aim for a commune in Colorado. Harry gives them a lift because that\u2019s more or less where he\u2019s going, but he declines, just now, to join the commune. He gives them his car, hitches a ride with a Las Vegas hooker, is (to his vast surprise) seduced by her, has a good time in Vegas, and, alas, is arrested for having a few too many.\n\nThis leads to the film\u2019s most hilarious scene. Harry is tossed into a cell already occupied by an ancient Indian (Chief Dan George) who has been arrested for practicing medicine without a license. The two old men gravely discuss recent television shows and the problem of bursitis, and the chief cures Harry\u2019s aching shoulder in return for an electric blender. Chief Dan George is so solemn, so understated, with Mazursky\u2019s dialogue that the result is a great comic scene.\n\nHarry and Tonto drift on West toward the Pacific, and we begin to get the sense that this hasn\u2019t been your ordinary road picture, but a sort of farewell voyage by a warm and good old man who is still, at seventy-two, capable of being thankful for the small astonishments offered by life. The achievement is partly Mazursky\u2019s, partly Carney\u2019s. \n\nMazursky has established himself as the master of a kind of cinema he calls \u201cserious comedy\u201d -- movies that make us laugh and yet have a special attitude toward their material and American society. His earlier films have included \u201cBob and Carol and Ted and Alice\u201d and the remarkable \u201cBlume in Love.\u201d\n\nArt Carney has, of course, fashioned a distinguished career for himself on the stage after all those years as Norton on \u201cThe Honeymooners.\u201d Here, he flowers as a movie star. The performance is totally original, all his own, and worthy of the Academy Award it received. It\u2019s not easy to make comedies that work as drama, too. But Carney\u2019s acting is so perceptive that it helps this material succeed.", "running_time": 115, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1974, "date_published": "1974-01-01", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "title": "Harry and Tonto (1974)"}
