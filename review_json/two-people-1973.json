{"url": "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/two-people-1973", "by": "Peter Fondaas Evan Bonner", "star_rating": 2.0, "text": "It must have sounded like such a good story idea, all those months or years ago when they were writing the film. Two people meet. He is an American deserter from the Vietnam War, living in Marrakesh. She is a high-fashion model from New York, visiting Marrakesh for a photo layout for Vogue. They meet by accident on a train, and over a period of the next couple of days they fall in love. And there is a catch: He is returning to New York to turn himself in.\n\nWhat we have here, potentially, is a sort of bittersweet, radicalized \u201cLove Story,\u201d and that must have been what sold the director, Robert Wise, on the project. The movie sounds superficially as if it might have a comment to make on the effect of the war on its warriors. Well, that may be true, but true of a movie they didn\u2019t make. What we\u2019re left with is an awfully awkward journey into banality. The movie\u2019s big structural weakness is the time it takes - about an hour - to lead up to the hero\u2019s big secret. Maybe 45 minutes before he tells the girl what he\u2019s done and who he is, we\u2019ve got it more or less figured out. If the movie had begun by saying, flat out, that here was a deserter who was turning himself in, maybe the situation could have been developed from there. As it is, the guy is so cool he\u2019s narcissistic.\n\nNobody plays narcissism on the screen better than Peter Fonda (although I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t the reason he was cast in the lead of \u201cTwo People\u201d). He has his father\u2019s reserve, but seemingly with a different source. I had a chance to see John Ford\u2019s \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d last week, with Henry Fonda in his great performance as Tom Joad and I couldn\u2019t help comparing the two men when they were both in their early 30s. Henry could bring a diffidence, a shyness, to a role; he had dignity and self-respect, but kept quiet about it until outrage made him act. (That\u2019s especially true of the Tom Joad role, if you overlook that ruinously idealistic speech at the end.) Peter can project the same reserve, but it doesn\u2019t seem to come from diffidence; it comes from a kind of sly arrogance about his own powers. So we don\u2019t feel emotionally responsible for the characters he plays; he seems to have made his own destiny and to be enjoying it. In \u201cTwo People,\u201d for example, we\u2019re supposed to identify with the moral crisis the Fonda character underwent in Vietnam. \n\nWe\u2019re supposed to feel for his years of exile, and to understand why, finally, he feels he must come back to the United States and take the consequences. But we don\u2019t, and it\u2019s not because of anything in the screenplay: It\u2019s because Fonda himself subtly projects the notion that, whatever happens to him in federal court, things are eventually going to turn out all right for good ol\u2019 No. 1. I got this same eerie feeling in \u201cEasy Rider\u201d; it was a punch in the gut when the Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper characters got killed, but Fonda, as Captain America, seemed merely to be riding to some masochistic-narcissistic rendezvous with all that flower power in the sky.\n\nSo his performance does tend to undermine the movie, but it has other things going against it, too. The dialog is both so obvious and so self-consciously \u201creal\u201d that the characters don\u2019t seem to be talking to each other, they seem to be taking positions on the issues. Lindsay Wagner, as the fashion model, is a movie newcomer (she\u2019s done a lot of television) who would be right for the role if it had really been thought out as a role. But the screenplay doesn\u2019t develop her character; it gives her unmotivated changes of personality in order to prod the Fonda character into the changes he goes through. And that\u2019s no way to treat a character; if the events don\u2019t seem to unfold naturally, you can\u2019t make them unfold by giving someone a big speech or a crying scene. No, not even if your backdrop is the American moral crisis in the second half of the 20th Century.
