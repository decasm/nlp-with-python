Young Victor Frankenstein, grandson of the count who started it all, returns by rail to his ancestral home. As the train pulls into the station, he spots a kid on the platform, lowers the window and asks, \"Pardon me, boy; is this the Transylvania Station\"?\n\nIt is, and Mel Brooks is home with \"Young Frankenstein,\" his most disciplined and visually inventive film (it also happens to be very funny). Victor is a professor in a New York medical school, trying to live down the family name and giving hilarious demonstrations of the difference between voluntary and involuntary reflexes. He stabs himself in the process, dismisses the class and is visited by an ancient family retainer with his grandfather's will.\u00a0\n\nFrankenstein quickly returns to Transylvania and the old ancestral castle, where he is awaited by the faithful houseboy Igor, the voluptuous lab assistant Inga, and the mysterious housekeeper Frau Blucher, whose very name causes horses to rear in fright. The young man had always rejected his grandfather\u2019s medical experiments as impossible, but he changes his mind after he discovers a book entitled How I Did It by Victor Frankenstein. Now all that\u2019s involved is a little grave-robbing and a trip to the handy local Brain Depository, and the Frankenstein family is back in business.\n\nIn his two best comedies, before this, \u201cThe Producers\u201d and \u201cBlazing Saddles,\u201d Brooks revealed a rare comic anarchy. His movies weren\u2019t just funny, they were aggressive and subversive, making us laugh even when we really should have been offended. (Explaining this process, Brooks once loftily declared, \u201cMy movies rise below vulgarity.\u201d) \u201cYoung Frankenstein\u201d is as funny as we expect a Mel Brooks comedy to be, but it\u2019s more than that: It shows artistic growth and a more sure-handed control of the material by a director who once seemed willing to do literally anything for a laugh. It\u2019s more confident and less breathless.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because the very genre he\u2019s satirizing gives him a strong narrative he can play against. Brooks\u2019s targets are James Whale\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein\u201d (1931) and \u201cBride of Frankenstein\u201d (1935), the first the most influential and the second probably the best of the 1930s Hollywood horror movies. Brooks uses carefully controlled black-and-white photography that catches the feel of the earlier films. He uses old-fashioned visual devices and obvious special effects (the train ride is a study in manufactured studio scenes). He adjusts the music to the right degree of squeakiness. And he even rented the original \u201cFrankenstein\u201d laboratory, with its zaps of electricity, high-voltage special effects, and elevator platform to intercept lightning bolts.\n\nSo the movie is a send-up of a style and not just of the material (as Paul Morrissey\u2019s dreadful \u201cAndy Warhol\u2019s Frankenstein\u201d). It looks right, which makes it funnier. And then, paradoxically, it works on a couple of levels: first as comedy, and then as a weirdly touching story in its own right. A lot of the credit for that goes to the performances of Gene Wilder, as young Frankenstein, and Peter Boyle as the monster. They act broadly when it\u2019s required, but they also contribute tremendous subtlety and control. Boyle somehow manages to be hilarious and pathetic at the same time.\n\nThere are set pieces in the movie that deserve comparison with the most famous scenes in \u201cThe Producers.\u201d Demonstrating that he has civilized his monster, for example, Frankenstein and the creature do a soft-shoe number in black tie and tails. Wandering in the woods, the monster comes across a poor, blind monk (Gene Hackman, very good) who offers hospitality and winds up scalding, burning, and frightening the poor creature half to death.\n\nThere are also the obligatory town meetings, lynch mobs, police investigations, laboratory experiments, love scenes, and a cheerfully ribald preoccupation with a key area of the monster\u2019s stitched-together anatomy. From its opening title (which manages to satirize \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d at the same time) to its closing, uh, refrain, \u201cYoung Frankenstein\u201d is not only a Mel Brooks movie but also a loving commentary on our love-hate affairs with monsters. This time, the monster even gets to have a little love-hate affair of his own.", "running_time": 108, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1974, "date_published": "1974-01-01", "genres": ["Comedy", "Science Fiction"], "title": "Young Frankenstein (1974)"}
