A more disciplined movie might have been made by eliminating some of the material and organizing the rest, but I\u2019m not sure it would have been a better movie, or a more moving experience. \u201cBlack Girl\u201d is hopeful - and frustrated - in all sorts of ways, just as its title character is. She\u2019s a 17 year-old with ambition and desire - she\u2019d like to be a ballet dancer - surrounded by a family that\u2019s filled with life, humor, common sense and, unfortunately, enough self-hate to make it almost a standoff. They mock her desires, in a way, because if she were to achieve them that would illuminate their own various failures.\n\nHer mother, Mama Rosie, is a woman of great energy, beauty and humor who doesn\u2019t think highly enough of herself or of any of her children. All of her hopes and fantasies are centered on her \u201cother daughter,\u201d a girl who boarded with them for a while before going off to college and a teaching diploma. This girl can do no wrong, Mama Rosie makes clear, but her own daughters can hardly do right. When Billie Jean, the youngest, tries to break loose from the destiny everybody seems to have in mind for her (get a job find a man, right away), the instinctive tendency is to slap her down for her ambition.\n\nBillie Jean is the child of her mother\u2019s second husband, an anonymous figure not remembered favorably in the household. Everyone - including her grandmother, who loves and rules them with matriarchal strength - is still fascinated by Mama Rosie\u2019s first husband and only love, Earl. And when Earl visits from Detroit, flashing a roll of hundreds and driving an El Dorado, the occasion somehow gets turned into still another put-down for Billie Jean.\n\nA more important visit takes place on Mother\u2019s Day, when Netta, the college student, comes to visit and is jealously attacked by Mama Rosie\u2019s two older daughters - and by Billie Jean reluctantly, because she was misled. But Netta has plans for Billie Jean, wants her to finish high school and apply for college admission. The others aren\u2019t used to seeing Billie Jean in that light. They\u2019re so accustomed to ridiculing her ambitions that they take her hopes as an affront. All of this material is worked together in a fairly clumsy way by J. E. Franklin\u2019s screenplay. Earl\u2019s visit home, for example, isn\u2019t really a catalyst and doesn\u2019t have an influence on Billie Jean\u2019s ultimate decision. It\u2019s used more to illuminate the character of Mama Rosie. \n\nNetta is not really developed, and becomes the stereotyped \u201cgood girl\u201d the others take her for; when she comes through with some revealing speeches of her own, near the film\u2019s end, nothing has prepared us. But the life of the film lies in its dialog and performances, which director Ossie Davis has wisely depended on to carry the story. We see a black family with more depth and complexity than the movies usually permit. The characters - especially Mama Rosie - grapple with great contradictions in their personalities, and try to find the best course, despite their weaknesses. When, at the end, Mama Rosie (who \u201cnever apologized to anybody for anything\u201d) says to her own mother: \u201cI just didn\u2019t want Billie Jean to wind up, like I did - like we all did;\u201d we understand.\n\nMama Rosie is played magnificently by Louise Stubbs, a former Chicagoan and Goodman Theater alumna who has very a difficult role. As I\u2019ve suggested, she\u2019s got to be fallible, weak and vain about her \u201cother daughter\u201d - and still have a basically good heart. Miss Stubbs succeeds in projecting both sides of this personality so that we believe in Mama Rosie as a real, and complicated, person.\n\nPeggy Pettitt, as Billie Jean, is also faced with a difficult assignment: She has to project her dreams through a character who\u2019s naturally shy and quiet. She does. Claudia McNeil is a fine, strong presence as the grandmother, and has a comic sparkle in several scenes, and an ability to take a stand in the later scenes, when it\u2019s needed. And Gloria Edwards carries much. of the movie\u2019s dramatic burden as Norma, the more hostile of Billie Jean\u2019s sisters.\n\n\u201cBlack Girl\u201d doesn\u2019t move with the smoothness and polish we usually expect in family dramas; the conflicts and urgencies aren\u2019t laid out one after another, as in a well-oiled stage or movie vehicle. But the rough edges and the sudden twists of plot give the movie a kind of open immediacy, and some of the texture of life. We don\u2019t even mind the scenes involving Earl\u2019s homecoming - scenes that really have little to do with Billie Jean\u2019s approaching crisis - because Brock Peters and Louise Stubbs play them with such humor and warmth. The story\u2019s energy is in such scenes, and they make \u201cBlack Girl\u201d into the kind of direct human experience we don\u2019t often get in movies.", "running_time": 97, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-02-06", "genres": null, "title": "Black Girl (1973)"}
