{"url": "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-red-machine-2010", "by": null, "star_rating": 3.5, "text": "\"The Red Machine\" is a lean, intense thriller about a disgraced spy for the U.S. Navy and a jailed safecracker who team up to steal the secret of the Japanese version of Enigma, the Nazi cryptography machine. It\u2019s set in Washington, D.C., in the 1930s when Japan and the United States still had diplomatic relations, and the target is a red cipher machine. \n\nSomething happened to Lt. F. Ellis Coburn (Lee Perkins) in Tokyo seven years earlier to turn him into the man we see. He looks to be a flawlessly turned-out Navy officer, but he\u2019s locked behind a stone face and a reputation all his superiors know about. In a climate of expanding promotions as the Navy prepares for war, everyone notices he\u2019s stuck at lieutenant.\n\nEddie Doyle (Donal Thoms-Cappello) is a cocky young thief straight from a 1930s pulp crime magazine. He approaches his craft as a science, noiselessly breaking and entering, breaking combinations, slipping into the night. He can pick locks and pockets, and works within a tight criminal fraternity ruled by Stella Snyder (Maureen Byrnes), a wise-talking hard-core case.\n\nNavy intelligence has broken all the Japanese codes but this one. The Red Machine baffles them. They assign Coburn to the task because of his undoubted skills and get Eddie released from jail for his particular specialty. Eddie will get them into the guarded embassy, and when Coburn sees the machine, he\u2019ll know what he\u2019s looking at. The machine itself can\u2019t be stolen; the Japanese must never suspect it has been compromised.\n\nThe drama also involves the Japanese ambassador Shimada (Eddie Lee) and his wife Naomi (Madoka Kasahara), who, almost inevitably, have links to the mysterious events in Tokyo seven years ago. And that\u2019s about it. These people, this stage, the red machine. \n\nThe movie, written and directed by the married pair of Stephanie Argy and Alec Boehm, doesn\u2019t fall back on stunts, chases or extended gun battles; it\u2019s in the honorable tradition of the heist movie. That involves blueprints, plans and the need to be very, very quiet. There\u2019s a nice scene when a safe is opened just behind an open door in Shimada\u2019s office. Coburn becomes so desperate to stall that he plays every card in his hand, including personal secrets.\n\n\u201cThe Red Machine\u201d is deeper than it first seems. The plot has hidden levels, and so do the characters, particularly the unlikely team of Doyle and Coburn. They don\u2019t like each other and don\u2019t like working together, and any possible personal progress is shut down by Coburn\u2019s fearsome reserve. He is taciturn to the point of aggression.\n\nNeither actor overplays. Perkins\u2019 role doesn\u2019t allow him. Thoms-Cappello\u2019s thief is supposed to be brash and dubious, which he is, but within reason. There\u2019s some subtle shifting going on that the directors suggest with visuals, not dialogue; an unspoken agreement to conspire takes place below the surface.\n\nHere\u2019s a film with an elegant simplicity. Not a shot doesn\u2019t do its work. It may remind you of a \u201940s B crime movie, and I mean that as a compliment. When you don\u2019t have a lot of explosions and special effects to exploit, you have to turn to the imagination \u2014 yours, and the audience\u2019s.", "running_time": 84, "mpaa_rating": "Unrated", "release_year": 2010, "date_published": "2010-08-18", "genres": ["Adventure", "Crime", "Drama"], "title": "The Red Machine (2010)"}
