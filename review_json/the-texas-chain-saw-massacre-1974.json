Partainas Frankle", "star_rating": 2.0, "text": "Now here\u2019s a grisly little item. \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d is as violent and gruesome and blood-soaked as the title promises -- a real Grand Guignol of a movie. It\u2019s also without any apparent purpose, unless the creation of disgust and fright is a purpose. And yet in its own way, the movie is some kind of weird, off-the-wall achievement. I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would want to make a movie like this, and yet it\u2019s well-made, well-acted, and all too effective.\n\nThe movie\u2019s based on factual material, according to the narration that opens it. For all I know, that\u2019s true, although I can\u2019t recall having heard of these particular crimes, and the distributor provides no documentation. Not that it matters. A true crime movie like Richard Brooks\u2019 \u201cIn Cold Blood,\u201d which studies the personalities and compulsions of two killers, dealt directly with documented material and was all the more effective for that. But \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d could have been made up from whole cloth without any apparent difference. No motivation, no background, no speculation on causes is evident anywhere in the film. It\u2019s simply an exercise in terror.\n\nIt takes place in an isolated area of Texas, which five young people (one of them in a wheelchair) are driving through in their camper van. They pick up a weirdo hitchhiker who carries his charms and magic potions around his neck and who giggles insanely while he cuts himself on the hand and then slices at the paraplegic. They get rid of him, so they think.\n\nBut then they take a side trip to a haunted-looking old house, which some of them had been raised in. The two girls laugh as they clamber through the litter on the floor, but one of the guys notices some strange totems and charms which should give him warning. They don\u2019t. He and his girlfriend set off for the old swimming hole, find it dried up, and then see a farmhouse nearby. The guy goes to ask about borrowing some gasoline and disappears inside.\n\nHis girl gets tired of waiting for him, knocks on the door, and disappears inside, too. A lot of people are going to be disappearing into this house, and its insides are a masterpiece of set decoration and the creation of mood. We see the innocent victims being clubbed on the hand, hung from meat hooks, and gone after with the chain saw.\n\nWe see rooms full of strange altars made from human bones, and rooms filled with chicken feathers and charms and weird relics. And gradually we realize that the house is inhabited by a demented family of retarded murderers and grave robbers. When they get fresh victims, they carve them up with great delight. What they do with the bodies is a little obscure, but, uh, they run a barbecue stand down by the road.\n\nOne way or another, all the kids get killed by the maniac waving the chain saw -- except one girl, who undergoes a night of panic and torture, who escapes not once but twice, who leaps through no fewer than two windows, and who screams endlessly. All of this material, as you can imagine, is scary and unpalatable. But the movie is good technically and with its special effects, and we have to give it grudging admiration on that level, despite all the waving of the chain saw.\n\nThere is, for example, an effective montage of quick cuts of the last girl\u2019s screaming face and popping eyeballs. There are bizarrely effective performances by the demented family (one of them, of course, turns out to be the hitchhiker, and Grandfather looks like Dustin Hoffman in \u201cLittle Big Man\u201d). What we\u2019re left with, though, is an effective production in the service of an unnecessary movie.\n\nHorror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they\u2019re brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can\u2019t get more conventional projects off the ground. \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d belongs in a select company (with \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and \u201cLast House on the Left\u201d) of films that are really a lot better than the genre requires. Not, however, that you\u2019d necessarily enjoy seeing it.", "running_time": 87, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1974, "date_published": "1974-01-01", "genres": ["Horror", "Thriller"], "title": "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)"}
