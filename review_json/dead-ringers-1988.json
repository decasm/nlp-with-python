We see a nod or a glance between one twin and another, and we imagine some kind of telepathic communication taking place, when in fact the whole transaction is probably just ordinary body language.\n\nTwins themselves always seem to keep some private place for their twinship. They do not talk about it much. They begin sentences that somehow seem to go nowhere, as if it is not quite possible to put into words what this particular relationship means to them. Most of us, I imagine, would like to have a twin; there is something awesome in the thought.\n\n\u201cDead Ringers\u201d is the vulgar exploitation-movie title given to David Cronenberg\u2019s new film, which was originally and more poetically titled \u201cTwins.\u201d It stars Jeremy Irons in a dual role as Beverly and Elliot Mantle, brilliant twins who grow up to be brilliant gynecologists. Beverly\u2019s name may be misleading; both twins are men, and they are unusually close, so much so that they routinely pretend to be each other.\n\nThe movie is not at all shy about exploiting the possibility that a woman going to see one of these gynecologists might end up being seen by the other. But that is only the beginning of their deception.\n\nWe discover that Elliot has always been the dominant twin, and that it is his practice to seduce a woman and then turn her over to Beverly - without telling the woman, of course. \u201cYou\u2019d still be a virgin if it weren\u2019t for me!\u201d he cries.\n\nOne of their girlfriends (Heidi Von Palleske) catches on. She is so genuinely in love with the one that she can detect the substitution. Her \u201creal\u201d lover apologizes, but does he mean it? Who would win out in such a tug-of-war? The girlfriend, or the twin? Then a famous actress (Genevieve Bujold) comes to consult them about why she cannot have children. The answer, in this most gynecologically precise of movies, is that she has three openings to her uterus, and an ambitious sperm is likely to get caught in traffic at the intersection.\n\nParts of the script seem lifted out of one of those women\u2019s magazine articles that treat the reproductive organs like a biological subway system.\n\nBujold begins a kinky love affair with Beverly, and shares not only her body but her drug habit. The drugs seem to release the craziness that has always been potential inside of him, and although his twin tries to cover for him, their lives eventually fly into pieces. In one particularly gruesome sequence, Beverly invents some new surgical instruments that look like daydreams by the Marquis de Sade and uses them in a bloody operation that looks like what you do to the turkey before the stuffing goes in.\n\nDoes all of this work? On one level, it\u2019s like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid. I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival with several women friends, who said it was harder for them to take than I, a man, could possibly imagine. But they were fascinated while it was on the screen. The secret may be that Cronenberg ( director of \u201cThe Dead Zone\u201d and \u201cThe Fly\u201d) approaches his trashy material with the objectivity of a scientist; it is his detached, cold style that makes the material creepy instead of simply sensational.\n\nOf course everything depends on Irons\u2019 performances as the twins. He is an intelligent, subtle actor, and he actually does succeed in making the twins into substantially different people. In ways so understated we are sometimes not even quite aware of them, he makes it clear most of them time whether we are looking at Beverly or Elliott.\n\nHe develops them separately, so that the chaos at the end really works.\n\nCronenberg is a master of special effects, as he demonstrated visibly in \u201cThe Fly\u201d and as he demonstrates invisibly here. As everyone knows, when the same actor plays two characters in the same scene, one of the techniques used is the split screen. Clever viewers can usually spot the line - usually hidden in shadow - where one part of the picture ends and the other begins, but Cronenberg uses \u201cmoving splits\u201d to fool them. Using computer technology, he can move the position of the split and the position of the camera at the same time, and he also sometimes drops in the split after one of the characters has just crossed the line where it will appear - so that we think that space is \u201creal.\u201d The result is that Irons convincingly appears as two separate people, and not as trick photography.\n\nThe technical perfection of the film is not matched by its emotional content. The story could have used more of the Bujold character, who is sophisticated and worldly enough to understand the twins, but who is dropped when they begin to retreat into their private disintegration. \u201cDead Ringers\u201d is a stylistic tour de force, but it\u2019s cold and creepy and centered on bleak despair. It\u2019s the kind of movie where you ask people how they liked it, and they say, \u201cWell, it was well made,\u201d and then they wince.", "running_time": 115, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-09-23", "genres": ["Drama", "Horror", "Indie", "Science Fiction", "Thriller"], "title": "Dead Ringers (1988)"}
