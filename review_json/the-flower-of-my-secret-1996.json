That's a common enough critical theory, and if there's truth in it, then his \u201cThe Flower of My Secret\u201d suggests intriguing possibilities. The Spanish director's new film tells the story of Leo, a woman who writes trashy but wildly popular romantic novels under a pseudonym. They pay well, but she despises them--hates them so much she adopts another pseudonym in order to write an article attacking them.\n\nDoes Almod\u00f3var feel the same way about his own career? I hope not, because his previous films, while uneven and not always successful, have at least exhibited a cheerful anarchic trashiness that would bring life to this new and more serious film.\n\nI was reminded while watching it of the Henry James story \u201cThe Next Time\u201d about two novelists--a popular writer who wants to be serious but is not good enough, and a serious writer who wants to be popular but is simply too good. Almod\u00f3var's strength lies in his popular entertainments, and perhaps he should get nowhere near drama except with his tongue in his cheek.\n\nLeo (Marisa Paredes), the film's key character, is rich because of her steamy potboilers, but not happy. Her husband Paco (Imanol Aris) believes there is no hope for their marriage, and we are inclined to agree since he has joined a peacekeeping mission to Bosnia simply to get away from her. Leo is depressed, drinks too much (\u201cDrinking is all I am really good at\u201d), tries to commit suicide, and discovers unhappy truths about Paco and herself.\n\nAlmod\u00f3var approaches her story through the stories of others.\n\nWe meet Leo's ailing mother, and Leo's sister, who has sacrificed heron life to care for their unpleasant parent. We meet Leo's best friend, who is having a secret affair with Paco. We learn that Leo\u2019s maid, one of the few pillars of her shaky existence, is about to bailout. The tone is set in an opening scene that seems real but turns out to be an educational film for potential organ donors.\n\nWhen these people meet, they talk and talk and talk. They weep, they wave their arms, they throw themselves onto convenient pieces of furniture. We have the materials here for a comedy, but not the willingness, and gradually the awful suspicion dawns that Almod\u00f3var himself, like Leo, is tired of his success and despairs that his producers will ever let him do something \u201cserious.\u201d One must be grateful for the gifts one is given, and Almod\u00f3var has been given irony and cynicism, hyperbole and irreverence.\n\nHe does not seem to have been given seriousness and deep purpose, but then he has never needed them, until now. \u201cThe Flower of My Secret\u201d is likely to be disappointing to Almod\u00f3var's admirers, and inexplicable to anyone else.", "running_time": 107, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1996, "date_published": "1996-05-24", "genres": ["Drama", "Foreign", "Romance"], "title": "The Flower Of My Secret (1996)"}
