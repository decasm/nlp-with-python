Even when he finally gets the bicycle of his dreams, he\u2019s allowed to ride it only on the sidewalk: He\u2019s a \u201cflat-lander.\u201d The movie is based on the popular TV series. I\u2019ve never watched a single episode of the series all the way through, but like most Americans I have a working knowledge of the Cleavers: Ward and June and their sons Beaver and Wally, and Wally\u2019s friend, the conniving Eddie Haskell. They lead the kinds of lives in which all problems can be solved in 22.5 minutes of program time; faced with an 88-minute movie, they almost run out of plot.\n\nBut the film is disarmingly charming, and, like \u201cGood Burger,\u201d pitched at young audiences. Whether they\u2019ll want to see it is a good question; kids these days seem to tilt more toward violent action pictures. I was surprised to find myself seduced by the film\u2019s simple, sweet story, and amused by the sly indications that the Cleavers don\u2019t live in the 1950s anymore.\n\nIn a way, all sitcom families are profoundly mad. They must be, to generate so many shallow emergencies, to talk only in one-liners, and to never leave the room without a punch line. \u201cLeave It to Beaver\u201d suggests a certain dark component to the Cleavers\u2019 sunniness, as in a moment when Ward (Christopher McDonald) experiences suppressed apoplexy after learning that the Beaver has \u201clost\u201d his new bike, or in another moment when we learn that June (Janine Turner), who always wears pearls and heels while vacuuming, may know it\u2019s a turn-on for her husband.\n\nThey live in a time suspended between 1957 and 1997. The cars look new, but they still use glass milk bottles. As the film opens, Beaver (Cameron Finley) wants a bike as badly as his father wants him to join the school football team. Easy, says Eddie Haskell (Adam Zolotin): Pretend to join the team, and your dad will buy you the bike.\n\nThe Beaver is so much smaller than the other team members that giving him a uniform seems like a form of child abuse. But he does join the team, briefly, and he does get the bike--only to have it stolen by a mean kid. Much of the plot involves the Beaver\u2019s attempts to get the bike back, and to conceal from his father that he\u2019s not playing in any games because of homework difficulties.\n\nWhen he finally does get in a game (because of a rule that everybody on the bench has to play at least a little), he\u2019s on his way to scoring a touchdown when a kid from the other team shouts, \u201cThrow me the ball,\u201d and he does. This of course causes him bottomless shame and remorse, and stirred ancient memories of my own about falling for such tricks--and practicing them. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a parallel plot involving Wally (Erik von Detten) and Eddie--kind of a romantic triangle, in which Wally coaches Eddie on how to win a girl, while the girl secretly has a crush on Wally.\n\nThe dialogue, by Brian Levant and Lon Diamond, has some nice moments: \"For a second he had the same kind of blubbering look he had when the lights came up at the end of 'The Lion King.'\" Or, when older brother Wally is asked to accompany the Beaver to school on the new bike: \u201cI get it--you don\u2019t want some truck turning the Beaver into road kill.\u201d Or, when the hostile girl rejects Eddie\u2019s advances: \u201cTake another step, and I\u2019ll file a restraining order.\u201d It\u2019s all sort of low-key and innocent, and depends on the guileless charm of young Cameron Finley, whose needs are simple: He only wants to be loved, respected and understood, and doesn\u2019t know yet that he\u2019ll feel that way for the rest of his life.", "running_time": 88, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1997, "date_published": "1997-08-22", "genres": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Family"], "title": "Leave It to Beaver (1997)"}
