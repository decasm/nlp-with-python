It\u2019s three hours long, it cost something like $13 million to make which was a lot at the time and it\u2019s an example of Hollywood commercial moviemaking at its finest. It\u2019s also a movie to make me happy I don\u2019t live in a high-rise; people above the seventh floor should find it thought-provoking. \n\nThe story involves a mythical 135-floor San Francisco skyscraper, which, through a combination of meticulously constructed models and convincing special-effects photography, looks realistic even though we know it\u2019s not. The building has been designed by architect Paul Newman, constructed by builder William Holden and sabotaged by the cost-cutting of his son-in-law, Richard Chamberlain. \n\nThere are ominous omens right from the beginning. All the principals arrive at the building for a big dedication party in the top floor restaurant, but meanwhile a generator shorts out and a small fire begins in an equipment room. The building has a state-of-the-art central communications and security system, but half the equipment doesn\u2019t work. As one of the big shots tells Holden: \u201cI told you we shouldn\u2019t have held the party until the safeguards were installed.\u201d Famous last words. \n\nThe original fire spreads, more electrical equipment malfunctions, gas leaks explode and in no time the tower is a mass of flames. Steve McQueen is the fire chief, calm, cool and courageous, even when he and a lot of his men are trapped above the blaze. He manages to move around pretty efficiently, however, by escaping down an elevator shaft only to be airlifted up to rescue the occupants of a stalled outside tourist elevator, and later to be dropped on the roof for some split-second heroics with Paul Newman. \n\nThe details of the fire are convincing; the explosions, the wreckage, the bombed-out inside fire escapes all look real. \u201cThe Towering Inferno\u201d is, in fact, a masterpiece of stunt co-ordination and special effects. And there\u2019s never that phony feeling we got in \u201cEarthquake,\u201d when you could see where the high-rise set stopped and the painted flats began. \n\nThe producer, Irwin (\u201cThe Poseidon Adventure\u201d) Allen, also directed the action sequences, and they\u2019re gems of exposition. What often happens in these complicated action pictures is that we lose track of the various characters and their various hazards. Not this time. There are five main action threads: Paul Newman\u2019s successful journey up and down a blasted-out stairwell to save a woman and two kids; the black-tie crowd waiting to be rescued in the luxurious 135th-floor restaurant; the maintenance of a breeches buoy; the business of saving a dozen people trapped in the outside elevator, and the final business involving 2 million gallons of water (I don\u2019t want to give away too much). \n\nThese threads are skillfully woven by Allen and his director, John Guillermin, who, although they give us what\u2019s advertised as \u201cfive great love stories,\u201d never allow the action to bog down too long for the various protestations of affection and last words. They are also mightily assisted by the fact that, although the building loses its power and mighty explosions rip apart whole floors, the telephone system never stops working. If McQueen below and Newman above hadn\u2019t been able to talk to each other, the story development would have run into some embarrassing problems. As it is, they develop a camaraderie under fire, and at the end exchange some pointed comments on high-rises in general: \u201cWe were lucky today,\u201d McQueen says. \u201cThe body count was only 200. One of these days 10,000 people are going to die in one of these firetraps.\u201d \n\nWhether high-rises are, indeed, firetraps is a debatable question; a more interesting question might involve the meaning of all those disaster films. \u201cThe Towering Inferno,\u201d \u201cAirport 1975,\u201d \u201cEarthquake\u201d and more to come, including a sequel to \u201cThe Poseidon Adventure.\u201d Was it that during hard times and uncertain world conditions we turned to escapist entertainment? Perhaps when we fear for ourselves, we go to disaster movies to face and exorcise greater fears. Or perhaps Hollywood simply rediscovered a dependable old genre and reinvigorated it with millions of bucks and lots of big-name stars. It was the same approach that would work in later years with horror, science fiction and other durable genres: Throw stars and money at them, and they deliver.", "running_time": 165, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1974, "date_published": "1974-01-01", "genres": ["Action", "Disaster", "Thriller"], "title": "The Towering Inferno (1974)"}
