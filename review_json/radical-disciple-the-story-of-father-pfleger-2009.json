It shows him in front of an altar made of orange crates and a white sheet, with candles and a Bible on it. My mother used to implore me to pray for a vocation to the priesthood. With little Mike Pfleger, there was never any doubt.\n\nMichael Pfleger is well known in Chicago and elsewhere as an outspoken liberal and civil rights advocate. The Roman Catholic hierarchy doesn\u2019t concern itself with its politics, but in the very public way he weaves them into his priesthood. He advocates politics in his sermons, shares his pulpit with others, leads demonstrations, speaks out. He invited the controversial Rev. Jeremiah Wright to speak from his altar before a reading by the poet Maya Angelou. At the height of the controversy in autumn 2008, he preached from Wright\u2019s altar.\n\nPolitics are not to be discussed from the pulpit. Nobody but a Catholic priest is to give a sermon. There is another problem. In the archdiocese of Chicago, a priest is assigned to a parish for six years, renewable once. Pfleger has been the pastor at St. Sabina\u2019s Church on the South Side since 1981. When he went there, he was the youngest Catholic pastor in Chicago. Now he has been there longer than any other priest has served in one parish in America. That has made a series of cardinals increasingly unhappy. Now 60, Pfleger seems to consider St. Sabina\u2019s a lifetime pastorate, and his congregation agrees. He walks a tightrope. \u201cSomebody is in my church every Sunday waiting to trip me,\u201d he says in this doc.\n\nPfleger feels a deep affinity with his parishioners. When he first came to the parish, the church was desolate, run down, sparsely attended, scheduled for closure. Soon it was packed for services. He led campaigns to restore the church. He rebuilt St. Michael\u2019s Academy, opened an employment resource center and social services center and built residences for senior citizens.\n\nThe elder housing is on land once occupied by bars, porno stores and hookers. Pfleger led campaigns against such stores, singling out merchants who sold alcohol or tobacco to minors, leading campaigns against billboards targeting teenagers, selling malt liquor and cigarettes. He was behind 20 Chicago billboards advising \u201cStop Listening to Trash,\u201d and attacking several rappers for their songs, often violent, that were disrespectful to women. He and the Rev. Jesse Jackson led demonstrations against gun-shop owners selling to inner-city youths.\n\nI have attended mass at St. Sabina\u2019s three or four times. The South Side congregation is predominantly African American, with a good sprinkling of other races. Pfleger is a gifted, impassioned orator. A black parishioner in this documentary says when she started going to the church, she sat in the back and couldn\u2019t see him. By his voice, she thought he sounded black.\n\nPfleger was an outspoken supporter of Barack Obama. It\u2019s not that he told his congregation it would be a sin to vote against him, it\u2019s more that he considered it unthinkable. The archdiocese fears his sermons will threaten its tax-exempt status. He has been reprimanded more than once by Cardinal Francis George, who would dearly love to reassign him and once put him on leave for two weeks to \u201cmeditate and reconsider.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe keeps a distance\u201d from the official church, says Sun-Times columnist Carol Marin in the documentary. She covered Pfleger for years as a TV reporter. He also doesn\u2019t bond readily with other priests. His focus is on his pastorate, not the church structure. However Pleger\u2019s theology remains orthodox. He is arguably the most loved white man in Chicago\u2019s African-American community. Among mainstream Catholics, not so much. \u201cHe is a follower of Marx,\u201d says Tom Roeser, head of the Catholic Citizens of Illinois.\n\nBob Hercules\u2019 documentary, screening as part of the Film Center\u2019s annual Black Harvest Film Festival, assembles archival and new footage and interviews into a comprehensive portrait. If you\u2019ve heard of Father Pfleger and want to know more, here is the place. What seems to be lacking is a fuller examination of the church\u2019s differences with its priest. Archdiocesan spokesmen are judicial. Roeser seems more concerned with Pfleger\u2019s politics than his theology. The most helpful view comes from Marin, who has covered him for 30 years, approves of him but questions some of his choices and strategies.\n\nOne thing seems certain. More than most priests, he has brought material change to the community and transformed his parish. Some of his most passionate actions can be seen as practicing the teachings of Jesus quite literally.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 2009, "date_published": "2009-08-26", "genres": null, "title": "Radical Disciple: The Story of Father Pfleger (2009)"}
