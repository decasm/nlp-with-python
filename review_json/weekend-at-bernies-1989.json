They discover that someone is stealing from the company and take their discoveries to Bernie, their boss (Terry Kiser), who is, in fact, the thief. He invites them to his summer home on an island, where he plans to have them killed. But first someone kills Bernie.\n\nThe young executives are frightened, and don\u2019t know what to do. They prop Bernie on a couch in the living room, and just then a floating party of weekend drunks drifts in - and nobody notices that Bernie is dead. This leads to a macabre weekend in which the hapless Bernie is carted around everywhere, apparently alive. He visits the beach and even goes boating, all as part of a desperate plot by the two heroes to conceal his death until they can find out who\u2019s trying to kill them.\n\nMovies centering on dead bodies are rarely very funny - which would be a truism if so many directors didn\u2019t try to make them. The most famous example is Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cThe Trouble with Harry,\u201d one of his less successful movies, but Blake Edwards did pull off the idea in \u201cS.O.B.,\u201d a movie in which a dead man is able, briefly, to play an important role.\n\nWhy don\u2019t dead characters work? The temptation is to say that we find them in bad taste - that the idea is too gruesome to be funny.\n\nBut comedy is often founded on bad taste and the offensive. I think the problem is more obvious. They don\u2019t work because they require the other characters to be so stupid.\n\nIn \u201cWeekend at Bernie\u2019s,\u201d for example, it should be immediately obvious to several people that Bernie is dead. In order for them not to notice, they must be incredibly dense. Their behavior in not noticing is so idiotic that we can\u2019t take them seriously, or care about what they do.\n\nOne answer might be to limit Bernie\u2019s exposure more severely - to show him just a little, at a distance, so that someone could plausibly be fooled by his appearance. To make his dead body a key element of the plot, but not the central one. In this movie, however, there are scenes in which characters actually wrap an arm around Bernie and hold business conversations with him. We can\u2019t believe they could be so unobservant.\n\nTo prove my point, one of the scenes that does work is successful because Bernie is kept off-screen. That\u2019s the one where his New York mistress (Catherine Parks) goes into a bedroom where Bernie\u2019s body awaits her, while the two heroes look at each other in consternation. When she emerges, she says Bernie has \u201cnever been better.\u201d What happened behind the closed door? The joke works because we don\u2019t know.", "running_time": 99, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 1989, "date_published": "1989-07-05", "genres": ["Comedy"], "title": "Weekend at Bernie's (1989)"}
