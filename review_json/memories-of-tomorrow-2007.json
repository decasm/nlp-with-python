Then he forgets how to drive a familiar route. The advertising executive keeps his worries to himself, but he can\u2019t hide his problems, and eventually a doctor delivers a dread prognosis: Early- onset Alzheimer\u2019s. He is only 49.\n\n\u201cMemories of Tomorrow\u201d is the first movie I\u2019ve seen about the disease that is told from the sick person\u2019s point of view, not that of family members. The director, Yukihiko Tsutsumi, often uses a subjective camera to show the commonplace world melting into bewildering patterns and meanings. The subject of the film, Saeki, is a high-octane ad executive with a young and eager team, and as a perfectionist it depresses him to discover his own imperfections mounting. He forgets dates, times, business meetings. In one breathtaking scene, he gets lost in Tokyo\u2019s urban maze and takes instructions from a secretary over his cell phone while literally running back to his office.\n\nThe character is played by Ken Watanabe (\u201cBatman Begins,\u201d \u201cMemoirs of a Geisha,\u201d \u201cLetters from Iwo Jima\u201d) and there is a personal element in his brave and painful performance. Watanabe is now 48, and since he was 30, I learn from the Japan Times, he has been fighting leukemia. His Saeki is just as determined to fight Alzheimer\u2019s, and is much aided by his patient and courageous wife Emiko (Kanako Higuchi), who writes notes naming everything in their house, prepares his daily schedule, and keeps up a brave front.\n\nHe holds on as long as he can, even accepting a lesser position and a smaller pension to stay with his company, but finally he must retire, and return to a home where now it is his wife who goes out every morning to earn a salary. He has better days and worse days, and a day fraught with fear when he must make a speech at his daughter\u2019s wedding. He loses the text of his speech. \u201cJust say anything,\u201d his wife whispers. \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201d She takes his hand.\n\nShe has the patience of a saint, but one day he physically hurts her. The director handles this painful moment with great visual tact, not showing it but instead cutting to the sudden darting of fish in an aquarium. And then his wife snaps, telling him with cold anger what a distant husband he has been, how flawed, how cruel.\n\n The movie isn\u2019t structured like a melodrama, but reflects a slow fading of the light. There are moments of almost unbearable sadness, as in what he reveals to a nurse at the end of a tour of a nursing home. And we observe the indifference of the company where he has been a salaryman all his life: Yes, thanks for your contribution, now go quietly, please, and don\u2019t let the clients know. Some films on Alzheimer\u2019s attempt to show an upside. I don\u2019t think there is an upside. At least with cancer you get to be yourself until you die.", "running_time": 122, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 2007, "date_published": "2007-11-29", "genres": null, "title": "Memories of Tomorrow (2007)"}
