They've even heard of\rmovie stars. They refer by name to Tom Cruise, Richard Gere, Jamie Lee Curtis.\rThey analyze motivations (\u201cDid Norman Bates have a motive? Did Hannibal Lecter\rhave a reason for wanting to eat people?\u201d) True, they went to the movies in \u201cThe\rLast Picture Show\u201d and the heroes of \u201cClerks\u201d worked in a video store. Even\rBonnie and Clyde went to the movies. But those movies were about the *act* of\rgoing to the movies. \u201cScream\u201d is about *knowledge* of the movies: The\rcharacters in \u201cScream\u201d are in a horror film, and because they've seen so many\rhorror films, they know what to do, and what not to do. \u201cDon't say 'I'll be\rright back,' \u201cone kid advises a friend, \u201cbecause whenever anybody says that,\rhe's *never* right back.\u201d In a way, this movie was inevitable. A lot of modern\rfilm criticism involves \u201cdeconstruction\u201d of movie plots. \u201cDeconstruction\u201d is an\racademic word. It means saying what everybody knows about the movies in words\rnobody can understand. \u201cScream\u201d is self-deconstructing; it's like one of those\rcans that heats its own soup.\n\nInstead\rof leaving it to the audience to anticipate the horror clich\u00e9s, the characters\rtalk about them openly. \u201cHorror movies are always about some big-breasted blond\rwho runs upstairs so the slasher can corner her,\u201d says a character in \u201cScream.\u201d\r\u201cI hate it when characters are that stupid.\u201d The movie begins, of course, with\ra young woman (Drew Barrymore) at home alone. She gets a threatening phone call\rfrom an evil Jack Nicholson sound-alike. She is standing in front of patio\rdoors with the dark night outside. She goes into a kitchen where there are lots\rof big knives around. You know the drill.\n\nLater,\rwe meet another young woman (Neve Campbell). Her father has left for the\rweekend. Her mother was murdered...why, exactly a year ago tomorrow! Her\rboyfriend climbs in through the window. At high school, rumors of cult killings\rcirculate. The killer wears a spooky Halloween costume named \u201cFather Death.\u201d\rThere are more phone calls, more attacks. The suspects include the boyfriend,\rthe father, and a lot of other people. A nice touch: The high school principle\ris The Fonz.\n\nAll\rof that is the plot. \u201cScream\u201d is not about the plot. It is about itself. In\rother words, it is about characters who *know* they are in a plot. These\rcharacters read Fangoria magazine. They even use movie-style dialogue: \u201cI was\rattacked and nearly filleted last night.\u201d The heroine has been rejecting her\rboyfriend's advances, and just as well: As another character points out,\rvirgins are never victims in horror films. Only bad boys and girls get slashed\rto pieces. Realizing they're in the midst of a slasher plot, the characters talk\rabout who could play them: \u201cI see myself as sort of a young Meg Ryan. But with\rmy luck, I'll get Tori Spelling.\u201d The movie itself, for all of its ironic\rin-jokes, also functions as a horror film--a bloody and gruesome one, that uses\ras many clich\u00e9s as it mocks.\n\nOne\rold standby is the scene where someone unexpectedly enters the frame,\rfrightening the heroine, while a sinister musical chord pounds on the\rsoundtrack. I love these scenes, because (a) the chord carries a message of\rdanger, but (b) of course the unexpected new person is always a harmless\rfriend, and (c) although we can't see the newcomer because the framing is so\rtight, in the real world the frightened person would of course be able to see\rthe newcomer all the time.\n\nThe\rmovie is also knowledgeable about the way TV reporters are portrayed in horror\rfilms. The reporter this time, played by Courteney Cox of \u201cFriends,\u201d asks\rwonderful questions, such as \u201cHow does it feel to almost be the victim of a\rslasher?\u201d Savvy as she is, she nevertheless suggests to a local deputy that\rthey shouldn't drive to an isolated rural setting when it's a nice night to\rwalk down a deserted country road in the dark while a slasher is loose.\n\nWhat\rdid I think about this movie? As a film critic, I liked it. I liked the in-jokes\rand the self-aware characters. At the same time, I was aware of the incredible\rlevel of gore in this film. It is *really* violent.\n\nIs\rthe violence defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it? For\rme, it was. For some viewers, it will not be, and they will be horrified.\n\nWhich\rcategory do you fall in? Here's an easy test: When I mentioned Fangoria, did\ryou know what I was talking about?", "running_time": 100, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1996, "date_published": "1996-12-20", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Horror", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "title": "Scream (1996)"}
