It is not so much about Paris as about a milieu of young people who live lives of bohemian liberation and are bored. They get drunk and sleep around and never, somehow, connect with anything that seems to make a difference.\n\nIf their lives are boring, the movie about them is not: Eustache sees through the world he is recording, he\u2019s cynical about his characters, and he has a feel for their mode of conversation. Their talk, for the most part, is either intellectual wit or confessional self-pity. The wit tries hard (as when they speculate that Sartre\u2019s entire philosophy is a cover-up for alcoholism, or talk about an avant-garde friend who wants to chop off his hand, encase it in plastic, and label it \u201cMy Hand--1940-1972\u201d). But mostly what they say seems second-hand, the anecdotes of yesterday afternoon.\n\nEustache gives us three characters: Alexandre (played by Truffaut\u2019s favorite actor, Jean-Pierre Leaud), Veronika (Francoise Lebrun) and Marie (Bernadette Lafont). They manage to form a triangle with about five sides. Alexandre\u2019s life is set mostly in cafes. He lives with Marie, and there is some talk that they\u2019re in love with each other, but search me. He has just been turned down by Gilberte, who he used to go with and wants to marry. Veronika looks something like Gilberte and, besides, he vowed to fall in love with the next girl he sees. He asks her out, and the rest of the movie (which is 3-1/2 hours long but not, for the most part, boring) is devoted to the games they play, the ploys they use, the confessions they make and the corners they back themselves into.\n\nMarie is the \u201cmother\u201d of the title, because she represents Alexandre\u2019s financial support and quasi-authority figure. Her boutique supports them both; he doesn\u2019t work but spends his afternoons in the same cafe \u201creading--as if it were a job.\u201d Veronika is the \u201cwhore\u201d--not literally, but because she thinks of herself that way because she\u2019s promiscuous. She hates herself for her promiscuity; all of the sex she\u2019s had means nothing against the prospect of falling in love with one man and having his baby. She tells the others this in a startlingly effective monolog that\u2019s all the more impressive when you realize Lebrun isn\u2019t a professional actress, but just someone Eustache knew.\n\nAlexandre cannot quite choose between the mother-figure and the whore-figure; he has got himself caught on the horns of the classical Freudian dilemma. If the movie thought his choice was all that important, it would be a disaster--but Eustache correctly sees that Alexandre\u2019s real problem is terminal immaturity, and that the women haven\u2019t grown up, either.\n\n\u201cThe Mother and the Whore\u201d is a brilliantly written film, and the performances are so good that, as I suggested, these aren\u2019t Parisians but people we know. The movie has been attacked on the grounds that it\u2019s Eustache\u2019s statement on women, but that\u2019s silly: It\u2019s his statement on these three silly, doomed, sometimes beautiful persons.", "running_time": 210, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 1974, "date_published": "1974-03-25", "genres": null, "title": "The Mother and the Whore (1974)"}
