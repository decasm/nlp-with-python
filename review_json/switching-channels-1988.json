The front page headlines changed from edition to edition to make the news seem forever breathlessly new. Now that kind of continuing update is left to television. Ever notice how Headline News updates the breaking stories while repeating the feature stuff over and over again? \u201cThe Front Page\u201d is, of course, a comedy about newspapers - the most famous newspaper comedy ever written. It was conceived in the hothouse of the Chicago newspaper world in the 1920s, when a dozen reporters were chasing every story and there were new editions all day long. Those were the days when a \u201cscoop\u201d meant you stole a story right out from under the other guy\u2019s nose. These days, an \u201cexclusive\u201d is more likely to mean you outbid the opposition for the serial rights to a TV star\u2019s steamy confessions.\n\nSo maybe it\u2019s only appropriate that the latest remake of \u201cThe Front Page\u201d involves not newspapers, but a TV cable news operation.\n\nBen Hecht and Charles MacArthur, who wrote the classic play, might even approve. They abandoned Chicago for Hollywood, where remakes were routine and the 1931 screen version of \u201cThe Front Page\u201d was updated nine years later in \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d by simply making one of the boys in the pressroom into a girl.\n\n\u201cThe Front Page\u201d was filmed again by Billy Wilder in 1974, with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, and now here is Ted Kotcheff\u2019s 1988 version, titled \u201cSwitching Channels\u201d and starring Burt Reynolds, Kathleen Turner and Christopher Reeve. It\u2019s not as good as \u201cHis Girl Friday,\u201d but it\u2019s comparable to the others.\n\nTurner plays a hard-driving TV news reporter who seems willing, in the opening credits, to go anywhere and do anything as long as the videotape is rolling. Reynolds is her ex-husband and current boss, the managing editor of the cable news operation. On a long-overdue vacation, Turner falls in love with Christopher Reeve, who plays a New York millionaire. She decides to quit TV, marry Reeve and move to New York. But hold on a minute: A famous criminal is scheduled to be executed at midnight, and Reynolds will do anything to keep his star reporter on the story.\n\nThis is more or less the same premise as the first three versions, allowing for the adjustments that have to be made when the star reporter is a woman (as Rosalind Russell was in the 1940 edition). Reeve\u2019s role has been greatly expanded (the fiance was mostly offstage in the earlier versions), and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good thing. Too much time is wasted while Reynolds and Reeve insult each other while the news is put on hold.\n\nBut Turner has perfect timing as the long-suffering anchor, and she and Reynolds work up a nice sweat and some good chemistry in their relationship, which seems to be based on a few good memories and a whole lot of one-liners. The Reeve character is unnecessary much of the time, but Reeve has fun with it anyway, with his floppy tailored suits, his newly blond hair and his willingness to accommodate the obviously derailed Turner.\n\nThe details of the update don\u2019t much matter, either. This time the convicted man is hidden inside a Xerox machine instead of a rolltop desk, but the basic mechanics of the original Hecht-MacArthur story are still sound, and \u201cSwitching Channels\u201d is true to the obsessive-compulsive hostility that is the fuel for all good reporters.\n\nThere is, however, one major lapse that should not go unreported.\n\nAs everyone who has ever seen the play knows, it ends with the most famous closing line in American theatrical history: \u201cThe son of a bitch stole my watch!\u201d The first two movie versions couldn\u2019t get away with that language, but the 1974 version did. And now here it is 1988, and \u201cSwitching Channels\u201d has the temerity to leave the line out altogether (even though Reynolds steals Reeve\u2019s expensive pen, in what looks like a setup). If the ghosts of Hecht and MacArthur see this movie, may they haunt the filmmakers, their spectral voices complaining, \u201cThe sons of bitches didn\u2019t steal our greatest line!\u201d", "running_time": 105, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-03-04", "genres": ["Comedy"], "title": "Switching Channels (1988)"}
