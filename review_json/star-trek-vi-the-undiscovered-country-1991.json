The implication is that the original voyage of \u201cStar Trek\u201d has come to an end--that the characters and players of the first television series and the six \u201cStar Trek\u201d movies will now go where no \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor has gone before, into retirement, and that if there is another \u201cStar Trek\u201d movie it will star, perhaps, the cast of TV\u2019s \u201cStar Trek\u201d The Next Generation.\u201d\n\nI am not so sure, however. This sixth \u201cStar Trek\u201d film has so much more life and interest than the dreary \u201cStar Trek V: The Final Frontier\u201d that perhaps it will tempt Paramount into still another story for Captain Kirk and his crew (perhaps a training voyage for the new generation?). \u201cStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\u201d begins, as so many \u201cStar Trek\u201d stories do, with a story set in the future but parallel to contemporary developments. In this case, as the Klingon empire begins to self-destruct after a Chernoble-type explosion on one of its moons, the obvious reference is to the disintegration of the Russian empire.\n\nAs the Klingons sue for peace, the Enterprise is assigned to go out to the edges of Federation space and negotiate with them. Captain Kirk is bitterly reluctant; he doesn\u2019t believe the Klingons can be trusted, ever. But Mr. Spock informs him of an alleged ancient Vulcan proverb: \u201cOnly Nixon can go to China.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of lines like that in the script by Nicholas Meyer and Denny Martin Flinn, and a lot of lines by Shakespeare, too, who supplies not only the movie\u2019s subtitle but also many references from \u201cHamlet\u201d and elsewhere (\u201cHe is better in the original Klingon,\u201d one of the enemy snorts.) At one point two of the supporting actors, the distinguished Shakespearians David Warner and Christopher Plummer, seem to be trading familiar quotations instead of dialog, but the strange thing is, it\u2019s effective; in its pop-culture way, \u201cStar Trek\u201d has taken on a kind of epic quality over the years, and such references help establish the notion that the story really does take place in a future that remembers the past.\n\nIf the dialog is from Shakespeare, the plot seems borrowed more from an old British country house mystery; one or more disloyal members of the Enterprise crew fire on a Klingon star cruiser and then port themselves on board to murder those who have come to ask for peace. Through plot complications that would have made Agatha Christie proud, the clues to the identify of the killers depend on bloody boots and bootprints, and figuring out who was where, and when.\n\n\u201cStar Trek\u201d has always been more allegory than science fiction. There is a kind of integrity, indeed, in the deliberately low-tech sets; the movies have always remained true to the klutzy art direction of the TV series, and in a post-\u201d2001\u201d and \u201cStar Wars\u201d age the bridge of the Enterprise still looks as if it were made out of old Captain Video props and a 1950s housewares show.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, because the movies aren\u2019t really based on sets, or even much on action; they\u2019re about ideas and relationships and here we see the old friendships of the Enterprise tested, and hear new versions of the same old jokes about how Vulcans don\u2019t understand jokes. It\u2019s entertaining, and reassuring.\n\nWhy on earth (or anywhere else) would Paramount want to retire this crew, which is as familiar and comforting as old family friends, and which does its job with the effortless grace of long familiarity? In Shakespeare, the \u201cundiscovered country\u201d is death. And elsewhere trhe bard refers to one who dies as being like an actor who goes off to \u201cstudy a long silence.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that will work here. I doubt frankly that the crew of the Enterprise can stop talking long enough to die.", "running_time": 113, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1991, "date_published": "1991-12-06", "genres": ["Action", "Family", "Mystery", "Science Fiction"], "title": "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)"}
