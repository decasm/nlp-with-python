It's one of those extraordinary films, like \u201cHoop Dreams,\u201d that tells a story the makers could not possibly have anticipated in advance. It works like stunning, grieving fiction. \n\nThe film opens like a big-picture documentary, showing us a huge crowd being directed by police as it grinds its way forward. We are informed that these are some of the 130 million Chinese citizens who make an annual train journey from urban centers to their provincial villages \u2014 \u201cthe largest human migration in the world.\u201d Umbrellas of every description protect them. They carry enormous bundles \u2014 gifts, perhaps, or food for the journey. They're headed home for the Chinese New Year.\rWe gradually center on Zhang Changhua and Chen Suqin, a married couple. Years ago, they left their home in the Szechuan province to take low-paying jobs in a textile factory in Guangzhou, which is the huge industrial city on the mainland next to Hong Kong. Here, in row after row, they work bent over sewing machines, assembling perhaps the jeans I'm wearing right now. They live in dormitories \u2014 married adults, with next to no privacy. \n\nThey save every yuan they can to send home. They left their children behind to be raised by a grandmother. Their dream is that by 15 years of this toil, they will pay for the children to finish school and live better lives. For that dream, they have sacrificed the life of parenthood, and are like strangers at home to children who know them as voices on the telephone, seen on the annual visit.\n\nThis is a reality Dickens could hardly have imagined. The fruit of their toil has contributed to China's emergence as a global economic power. But their lives are a grim contrast to the glittering Beijing of the Olympics, the towers of Shanghai, the affluent new business class. And here is the part you may sense coming: Are their children grateful for what amounts to the sacrifice of two lifetimes?\n\nThe filmmaker, Lixin Fan, follows this family for three years, in the city and in the village. We hear much about how Chinese parents pressure their children to study hard and excel. Overseas, they frequently do succeed. But China is a huge nation, so large that a generation may not be long enough to rise from poverty. \n\nTheir daughter, Zhang Qin, is in high school, and comes to regard her parents as distant strangers \u2014 and nags. She's had enough of it. But what she does is beyond heartbreaking. She moves to Guangzhou and gets a factory job. She does the math. If she keeps her wages instead of sending them home, she'll have them to spend on herself. Does it occur to her to suggest her parents move back home with her brother, while she helps support and repay them? Not a chance.\n\nThere is so much to say about this great film. You sense the dedication of Lixin Fan and his team. (He did much of the cinematography and editing himself.) You see once again the alchemy by which a constantly present camera eventually becomes almost unnoticed, as people live their lives before it. You know the generations almost better than they know themselves, because the camera can be in two places and they are usually in one or the other.\n\nThere is a quiet moment in a mall. On their day off, Zhang Qin and her friends go shopping. They like a pair of jeans: \u201cAre these made in our factory?\u201d No, in another. Of course they want them. Of course their generation wants them. But their generation doesn't want to work years leaning over a sewing machine and sleeping in a dorm.\n\nWe read about the suicides in Apple's plants in China. Seeing this film, you suspect there are many suicides among workers in factories whose brands are less famous than Apple. Chinese peasants no longer live without television and a vision of another world. They no longer live in a country without consumer luxuries. \u201cLast Train Home\u201d suggests that the times they are a-changin'. The rulers of China may someday regret that they distributed the works of Marx so generously.", "running_time": 85, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 2010, "date_published": "2010-10-13", "genres": ["Documentary", "Drama", "Foreign", "Indie"], "title": "Last Train Home (2010)"}
