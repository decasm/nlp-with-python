This entire movie is nothing but one vast secret that shouldn\u2019t be revealed. I tried writing a paragraph in which I would summarize the \u201chook\u201d - the first five minutes of the movie, and I found I couldn\u2019t even do that without fudging. Almost nothing can be said about this film that would not eventually turn out to be a distortion of the plot.\n\nSo let me just tell you some things that may or may not be true. One New Year\u2019s Eve, while speeding home on a twisting mountain road after a party, a couple is nearly killed when their car flies off the road and tumbles down a steep embankment. The wife (Greta Scacchi) is thrown free, and escapes with some bad bruises. But the hospital informs her that her husband (played by Tom Berenger) is critically injured and in a deep coma.\n\nEventually he does live, and after extensive plastic surgery he even stops looking like Frankenstein\u2019s monster. But he has selective amnesia. \u201cYou can remember who\u2019s president,\u201d Scacchi explains to him, \u201cbut nothing about your family.\u201d Sort of like being on the White House staff. Even though he can\u2019t remember Scacchi, he falls in love with her all over again, especially after she unbuttons her blouse (everyone in this film must have seen \u201cRegarding Henry\u201d).\n\nThere are, however, many clues indicating that all is not well. Such as: a roll of photographs hidden in the tobacco canister.\n\nThe warnings of the family\u2019s best friend (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer). The discoveries of a colorful private eye (Bob Hoskins). The testimony of the manager of the local hotel where everyone goes to commit adultery. And, of course, those troublesome nightmare memories from the night of the accident, involving the abandoned ship down by the old marina.\n\nThere is no possible explanation that will tie everything together - and if you don\u2019t believe me, see the movie. The key to the mysteries, when it comes, is not only utterly, inconceivably implausible, but raises so many questions that the movie really could benefit from another 30 minutes or so, during which the Scacchi character could deliver a helpful explanatory monologue straight into the lens.\n\nAnd yet \u201cShattered\u201d has its qualities, among them the dogged persistence of the Bob Hoskins character (whose explanation for still being alive at the end of the film is a howler). Wolfgang Petersen\u2019s direction is shadowy and portentious, and filled with omens, and his screenplay is too clever by half, which is always sort of fun. The movie is finally so ridiculous it cannot be taken seriously as a thriller or anything else, but there are moments that work, and you\u2019ll love the look on the hero\u2019s face when he discovers the identity of the dead body.", "running_time": 97, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1991, "date_published": "1991-10-11", "genres": ["Mystery", "Suspense", "Thriller"], "title": "Shattered (1991)"}
