Gittes", "star_rating": 4.0, "text": "\u201cAre you alone?\u201d the private eye is asked in Roman Polanski\u2019s \u201cChinatown.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t everybody?\u201d he replies. That loneliness is central to a lot of noir heroes, who plunder other people\u2019s secrets while running from their own. The tone was set by Dashiel Hammett, and its greatest practitioner was Raymond Chandler. To observe Humphrey Bogart in Hammett\u2019s \u201cThe Maltese Falcon\u201d and Chandler\u2019s \u201cThe Big Sleep\u201d (1946) is to see a fundamental type of movie character being born -- a kind of man who occupies human tragedy for a living.\n\nYet the Bogart character is never merely cold. His detachment masks romanticism, which is why he\u2019s able to idealize bad women. His characters have more education and sensitivity than they need for their line of work. He wrote the rules; later actors were able to slip into the role of noir detective like pulling on a comfortable sweater. But great actors don\u2019t follow rules, they illustrate them. Jack Nicholson\u2019s character J.J. Gittes, who is in every scene of \u201cChinatown\u201d (1974), takes the Bogart line and gentles it down. He plays a nice, sad man.\n\nWe remember the famous bandage plastered on Nicholson\u2019s nose (after the Polanski character slices him), and think of him as a hard-boiled tough guy. Not at all. In one scene he beats a man almost to death, but during his working day he projects a courtly passivity. \u201cI\u2019m in matrimonial work,\u201d he says, and adds, \u201cit\u2019s my metier.\u201d His metier? What\u2019s he doing with a word like that? And why does he answer the telephone so politely, instead of barking \u201cGittes!\u201d into it? He can be raw, he can tell dirty jokes, he can accuse people of base motives, but all the time there\u2019s a certain detached underlevel that makes his character sympathetic: Like all private eyes, he mud wrestles with pigs, but unlike most of them, he doesn\u2019t like it.\n\nNicholson can be sharp-edged, menacing, aggressive. He knows how to go over the top (see \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and his Joker in \u201cBatman\u201d). His performance is key in keeping \u201cChinatown\u201d from becoming just a genre crime picture -- that, and a Robert Towne screenplay that evokes an older Los Angeles, a small city in a large desert. The crimes in \u201cChinatown\u201d include incest and murder, but the biggest crime is against the city\u2019s own future, by men who see that to control the water is to control the wealth. At one point Gittes asks millionaire Noah Cross (John Huston) why he needs to be richer: \u201cHow much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can\u2019t already afford?\u201d Cross replies: \u201cThe future, Mr. Gitts, the future.\u201d (He never does get Gittes\u2019 name right.)\n\nGittes\u2019 involvement begins with an adultery case. He\u2019s visited by a woman who claims to be the wife of a man named Mulwray. She says her husband is cheating on her. Gittes\u2019 investigation leads him to Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), to city hearings, to dried river beds and eventually to Mulwray\u2019s drowned body and to the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). Stumbling across murders, lies and adulteries, he senses some larger reality beneath everything, some conspiracy involving people and motives unknown.\n\nThis crime is eventually revealed as an attempt to buy up the San Fernando Valley cheaply by diverting water so that its orange growers go broke. Then that water and more water, obtained through bribery and corruption, will turn the valley green and create wealth. The valley has long been seen as a key to California fortunes: I remember Joel McCrea telling me that on his first day as a movie actor, Will Rogers offered two words of advice: \u201cBuy land.\u201d McCrea bought in the valley and died a rich man, but he was in the second wave of speculation.\n\nThe original valley grab was the Owne River Valley scandal of 1908, mirrored in the 1930s by Towne. In the preface to his Oscar-winning screenplay, he recalls: \u201cMy wife, Julie, returned to the hotel one afternoon with two quilts and a public library copy of Carey McWilliams\u2019 Southern California Country, an Island on the Land --and with it the crime that formed the basis of Chinatown.\u201d McWilliams, for decades the editor of the Nation, presented Towne not only with information about the original land and water grab, but also evoked the old Los Angeles, a city born in a desert where no city logically should be found. The screenplay explains, \u201cEither you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.\u201d John A. Alonzo\u2019s cinematography, which got one of the movie\u2019s 11 Oscar nominations, evokes the L.A. you can glimpse in the backgrounds of old movies, where the sun beats down on streets that are too wide, and buildings seem more defiant than proud. (Notice the shot where the bright sun falls on the fedoras of Gittes and two cops, casting their eyes into shadows like black masks.)\n\nGittes becomes a man who just wants to get to the bottom of things. He\u2019s tired of people\u2019s lies. And where does he stand with Evelyn Mulwray, played by Dunaway as a cool, elegant woman who sometimes--especially when her father is mentioned -- seems fragile as china? First he\u2019s deceived by the fake Evelyn Mulwray, and then by the real one. Then he thinks he loves her. Then he thinks he\u2019s deceived again. Then he thinks she\u2019s hiding her husband\u2019s mistress. Then she says it\u2019s her sister. Then she says it\u2019s her daughter. He doesn\u2019t like being jerked around.\n\nHer father the millionaire is played by Huston with treacly charm and mean little eyes. There is a luncheon where he serves Gittes a fish with the head still on, the eyes regarding the man about to eat it. \u201cJust as long as you don\u2019t serve the chicken that way,\u201d Gittes says. In life and on the screen, Huston (who directed \u201cThe Maltese Falcon\u201d) could turn on disarming charm by admitting to his failings: \u201cOf course I\u2019m respectable. I\u2019m old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.\u201d\n\nLike most noir stories, \u201cChinatown\u201d ends in a flurry of revelation. All is explained, relationships are redefined, and justice is done -- or not. Towne writes of \u201cmy eventual conflict with Roman and enduring disappointment over the literal and ghoulishly bleak climax\u201d of the movie. Certainly the wrong people are alive (and dead) at the end of the film, but I am not sure Polanski was wrong. He made the movie just five years after his wife, Sharon Tate, was one of the victims of the Manson gang, and can be excused for tilting toward despair. If the film had been made 10 years later, the studio might have insisted on an upbeat ending, but it was produced during that brief window when Robert Evans oversaw a series of Paramount\u2019s best films, including \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d\n\nFor Polanski, born in 1933 in Paris, reared in Poland, \u201cChinatown\u201d was intended as a fresh start in Hollywood. After several brilliant thrillers made in Europe in the early 1960s (\u201cKnife in the Water,\u201d \u201cRepulsion\u201d), he came to California and had an enormous success (\u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby,\u201d 1968). Then came the Manson murders, and he fled to Europe, making the curious \u201cMacbeth\u201d (1971), with its parallels to the cult killings. After \u201cChinatown\u201d came charges of sex with an under-age girl, and exile in Europe. \u201cChinatown\u201d shows he might have developed into a major Hollywood player, instead of scurrying to finance bizarre projects such as \u201cPirates\u201d (1986).\n\nFor Nicholson, the role had enormous importance. After a decade\u2019s slumming in exploitation films, he made an indelible impression in \u201cEasy Rider\u201d and followed it with strong performances in \u201cFive Easy Pieces\u201d (1970), \u201cCarnal Knowledge\u201d (1971) and \u201cThe Last Detail\u201d (1973). But with Jake Gittes he stepped into Bogart\u2019s shoes as a man attractive to audiences because he suggests both comfort and danger. Men see him as a pal; wise women find weary experience more attractive than untrained lust. From Gittes forward, Nicholson created the persona of a man who had seen it all and was still capable of being wickedly amused. He could sit in the front row at a basketball game and grin at the TV camera as if he expected the players to commit lascivious deeds right there on the floor.\n\n\u201cChinatown\u201d was seen as a neo-noir when it was released -- an update on an old genre. Now years have passed and film history blurs a little, and it seems to settle easily beside the original noirs.
