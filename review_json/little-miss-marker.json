Look at his work in \u201cLittle Miss Marker.\u201d This is a thoroughly pleasant, lightweight comedy that obviously needs Matthau at its center if it\u2019s going to work (I can\u2019t think of another actor who could do quite this job).\n\nSo Matthau occupies the center, he\u2019s on screen most of the time, he gives us that loping Matthau shamble of a walk, that plastic face with the grin of chagrin, those hound dog eyes and that gravel voice. We have seen all of these attributes before but they\u2019ve never quite seemed as they do here.\n\nThat\u2019s because Matthau, one of the most instantly recognizable actors in the world, never just gives us Matthau. He is an actor as well as an inimitable performer, and in \u201cLittle Miss Marker\u201d he makes the character of Sorrowful Jones distinctive from all the other characters that have been inhabited by the Matthau persona.\n\nSorrowful is, of course, a classic creation of Damon Runyon (and if you think \u201cDamon Runyon\u201d is an intersection on the West Side, Runyon woulda loved ya). He\u2019s a temperamentally pessimistic, glum-faced bookie who inhabits a Runyon world of horse players, crooked cops and little old ladies with a hot tip on the fifth race.\n\nOne day a gambler who\u2019s run out of credit comes into the betting parlor and offers to leave his minute little daughter as a guarantee of payment. She\u2019s the marker. And when her father doesn\u2019t come back, Sorrowful is stuck with her \u2013 along with various possible kidnapping charges.\n\nThe first time around, in 1934, \u201cLittle Miss Marker\u201d made Shirley Temple a star, and Adolphe Menjou was Sorrowful Jones. The second time around, in 1949, \u201cSorrowful Jones\u201d starred Bob Hope in the title role, and wasn\u2019t nearly as good. This third time around, writer-director Walter Bernstein has stuck more closely to Runyon\u2019s original inspiration, and his movie is unpretentious, old-fashioned fun.\n\nIt is also a movie that makes you feel very good at times, largely because of the rapport between Matthau and young Sara Stimson, a very small little girl from Texas who looks nothing at all like Shirley Temple. Stimson is tiny and also very grave, and she has big, silent eyes. When she looks at Matthau we can almost feel his cynical heart trying to remember how to love.\n\nStimson plays all her scenes very close to her chest (she seems to be the sort of young lady who counts her M & Ms to see if she was shortchanged). And Matthau is subtle, too, in his behavior toward her: Instead of playing this obviously corny relationship for big corny sniffles, the movie goes more for dry wit and understatement. The strategy works.\n\nSome movie kids, like Ricky Shroeder in \u201cThe Champ,\u201d are so lovable we want to send them out to try to field a bunch of fast grounders. Other kids, like Justin Henry in \u201cKramer vs. Kramer\u201d and Sara Stimson in this one, are more simply kidlike. That leads to some astonishing results, as in the scenes where, for the life or us, we can\u2019t figure out whether Matthau or the kid understands the situation better.\n\nThe supporting cast is filled with big names, all of them upstaged by the Matthau-Stimson axis. Tony Curtis plays a slick, fast-talking gambling boss, Julie Andrews plays his girlfriend and falls in love with Matthau, and Bob Newhart is appropriately jumpy as Matthau\u2019s assistant who is familiar with the kidnapping statutes.\n\nThe one mistake in casting is Lee Grant as the judge; in old-fashioned tear-jerkers of this sort we\u2019re just not ready for a liberated female judge. But \u201cLittle Miss Marker\u201d survives; it\u2019s goofy, corny, well-acted and fun. And when Stimson grows up she may bring silence back into fashion.", "running_time": 103, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1980, "date_published": "1980-03-21", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Family", "Romance"], "title": "Little Miss Marker (1980)"}
