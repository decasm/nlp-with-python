{"url": "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/aria-1988", "by": "Don Boyd", "star_rating": 3.0, "text": "None of the directors chose to just go ahead and film their aria in a straightforward traditional way. Bill Bryden comes closest, with a wraparound segment starring John Hurt as a has-been virtuoso remembering his happier days. His story continues between each of the other arias, and finally he stands alone on stage and sings the famous aria from \u201cIl Pagliacci,\u201d an opera about a man who found he could smile through his sadness. (Hurt did not learn to sing for the movie; he mimes Caruso, and indeed all of the segments feature prerecorded performances.) Of the 10 segments, I particularly enjoyed Franc Roddam\u2019s interpretation of \u201cLiebestod,\u201d from Wagner\u2019s \u201cTristan und Isolde.\u201d He uses Bridget Fonda and James Mathers as young lovers who arrive in Las Vegas, drive slowly and (given the music) sadly down Glitter Gulch, check into a cheap hotel room, make love and kill themselves. Despite, or perhaps because of, the unlikely setting, the episode is truly poignant in its protrait of the two doomed lovers.\n\nNicholas Roeg\u2019s vision of Verdi\u2019s \u201cUn Ballo in Maschera,\u201d stars his wife, Theresa Russell, made up as a man, in a story based on the attempted assassination of King Rog of Albania in 1931 (you see how fanciful the directors were allowed to become). Charles Sturridge begins with Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Vergine Degli Angeli\u201d from \u201cLa Forza del Destino\u201d and illustrates it with the story of three teenagers who skip school and end up in a traffic accident. Godard uses Lully\u2019s \u201cArmide\u201d as an excuse for a segment about body builders. Julien Temple, the brash young British director, shoots his illustration of Verdi\u2019s \u201cRigoletto\u201d in the famous Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo, Calif., and stars Buck Henry as a movie producer who sneaks away with Beverly D\u2019Angelo to the very hotel where his wife has also repaired with her lover.\n\nRobert Altman\u2019s segment on Rameau\u2019s \u201cLes Boreades\u201d re-creates the opening night in 1734 at the Parisian Ranelagh Theater, where he imagined the audience as being filled with a raffish and perhaps diseased assortment of lowlives and the decadent. Bruce Beresford re-creates the seemingly dead city of Bruges, Belgium, to illustrate Korngold\u2019s \u201cDie Tote Stadt.\u201d Ken Russell chooses Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot\u201d and uses the British pin-up model Linzi Drew as his subject. She imagines her body is being adorned by jewels, but wakes up in an operating room where she is receiving emergency care after a car crash.\n\nThe mixture is typical of Russell\u2019s taste for exoticism and sensation.\n\nThe final segment by Derek Jarman shows a veteran opera singer at her last performance, intercut by 8mm home movies of an early love affair.\n\nAt the end of \u201cAria\u201d one must decide, I suppose, what it all means. I am not sure that any indispensable statement about opera has been made here, and purists will no doubt recoil by the irreverence of some of the images. But the film is fun almost as a satire of itself, as a project in which the tension between the directors and their material allows them to poke a little fun at their own styles and obsessions. You could almost call \u201cAria\u201d the first MTV version of opera.", "running_time": 90, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-07-01", "genres": null, "title": "Aria (1988)"}
