Arkoff, the film's producer, and Rex Reed, the\r\ncritic:\u00a0\n\n\r\nReed: Sam! I just saw \u201cThe Winged Serpent\u201d! What\r\na surprise! All that dreck--and right in the middle of it, a great Method performance\r\nby Michael Moriarty!\n\nArkoff: The dreck was my idea.\n\n\r\nI believe him. Arkoff has been producing films\r\nfor thirty years now, and even if he was honored with a retrospective at the\r\nMuseum of Modern Art, his heart still lies with shots of a giant flying lizard\r\nattacking a woman in a bikini on top of a Manhattan skyscraper. He's just that\r\nkinda guy. There are, in fact, several shots in \u201cQ\u201d that owe their ancestry to\r\nSam Arkoff. I am aware, of course, that Larry Cohen gets credit for having\r\nwritten and directed this movie, but where would Cohen or any other director be\r\nwithout the rich heritage of a quarter-century of American-International\r\nPictures made by Sam Arkoff? Here are examples of the shots I have in mind:\n\n\r\n\u00b7 The camera looks straight down at terrified\r\ncitizens fleeing from a menace. They run crazily across the street. Some run\r\naway from the camera, some toward it, so that you can't tell for sure where the\r\nmenace is, and the shot can be intercut with shots of a menace approaching from\r\nany direction.\u00a0\r\n\u00b7 The hero empties his machine gun into the\r\ngiant serpent and turns away from a window to issue orders: \"Everybody\r\nhold your positions!\" Just then the serpent reappears behind him.\u00a0\r\n\u00b7 There are False Serpent Alarms in which people\r\nget hit from behind by toy birds, chairs, and their boyfriends.\u00a0\r\n\u00b7 David Carradine says, \"He doesn't die\r\neasy.\" You get the idea. \u201cQ\u201d is another silly monster movie. But think how\r\nlong it's been since we had another silly monster movie. There was a time\r\nduring the golden age of Sam Arkoff's career when there were lots of monster\r\nmovies. Remember, for example, \u201cAttack of the Crab Monsters\u201d, \u201cViking Women and\r\nthe Sea Serpent\u201d, \u201cCreature from the Haunted Sea\u201d, and \u201cThe Wasp Woman\u201d. But in\r\nthe last few years Creature Features have been replaced by Dead Teenager\r\nMovies, and instead of awful special effects of a monster going berserk, we get\r\nworse shots of a homicidal maniac going berserk.\u00a0\n\n\r\n\u201cQ\u201d returns to the basic formula, in which a\r\nprehistoric creature terrorizes the city. In this case, the creature is a\r\nQuetzalcoatl, a mythical Aztec monster with wings and four claws. It apparently\r\nhas been brought back into existence in connection with some shady human\r\nsacrifices at the Museum of Natural History (although this particular subplot\r\nis very muddled). It lives in a nest at the top of the Chrysler Building, lays\r\neggs, and terrorizes helpless New Yorkers, who are not sure if this is a real\r\nmonster or another crazy circulation stunt by Rupert Murdoch.\u00a0\n\n\r\nRex Reed was right, though, about the Method\r\nperformance by Michael Moriarty. In the middle of this exploitation movie,\r\nthere's Moriarty, rolling his eyes, improvising dialogue, and acting creepy.\r\nHe's fun to watch, especially in the scene where he names his terms for leading\r\nthe cops to the lizard. The cast also includes David Carradine, Richard\r\nRoundtree, and Candy Clark, good actors all, but you have to be awfully good not\r\nto be upstaged by the death throes of a dying Quetzalcoatl.\u00a0\n\n\r\nStill to be answered: How did one Quetzalcoatl\r\nget pregnant?\n\n", "running_time": 93, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1982, "date_published": "1982-01-01", "genres": ["Horror"], "title": "Q (1982)"}
