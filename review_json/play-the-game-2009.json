Griffith plays Grandpa Joe, who lost his beloved wife two years ago. Now his grandson Dave (Paul Campbell) thinks it\u2019s time for him to start dating again. After all, he isn\u2019t getting any younger.\n\nGrandpa Joe is pretty much on standby in his retirement home. He\u2019d like to get cozy with Rose (Doris Roberts of \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d). But he\u2019s unprepared for the wiles of Edna (Liz Sheridan, who played Seinfeld\u2019s mom on TV). She supplies Joe with Viagra, and he more or less seduces her on autopilot.\rDave considers himself a babe magnet. He\u2019s a genius at fast-talking himself into relationships that, alas, have a way of ending once he\u2019s run through his prepared material. He\u2019s also a whiz at selling cars, but at least then when he makes a sale, the victim drives it off the lot.\n\nThe screenplay, written by first-time director Marc Fienberg, fervently stays true to an ancient sitcom tradition. We somehow suspect Grandpa Joe will end up with the adorable Rose, and whaddaya know, Dave finds genuine love with Julie, Rose\u2019s granddaughter (Marla Sokoloff).\n\nAnd that\u2019s about it, except for a closeup of Andy Griffith that I could easily have lived without. I\u2019ve admired Griffith ever since \u201cNo Time for Sergeants\u201d (1958), but the one thing I must admit I\u2019ve never wanted to do was regard his face while he\u2019s enjoying oral sex from Seinfeld\u2019s mom.\n\nI have a good friend whose own dad discovered Viagra in a retirement home and would call his son almost daily to recount his latest adventures. He called once when I was in the room with my friend, who urgently told him, \u201cDad, I\u2019ve told you, I don\u2019t want to know!\u201d\n\nI told him the old one about the old lady who runs naked into the TV room of her retirement village shouting, \u201cSuper sex! Super sex!\u201d One of the guys perks up and says, \u201cI\u2019ll have the soup, please.\u201d", "running_time": 105, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 2009, "date_published": "2009-08-26", "genres": ["Comedy", "Indie", "Romance"], "title": "Play the Game (2009)"}
