That apparently is often the case, I\u2019m told, especially with works by such older masters as Mizoguchi and Ozu, who were working for their Japanese audiences with no thought that their films might someday be shown in such exotic places as Chicago.\n\nThe work of the great Akira Kurosawa (\u201cIkiru,\u201d \u201cThe Seven Samurai\u201d) is, however, a great deal more accessible to Western audiences, and now comes a Japanese \u201cnew wave\u201d of directors who treat the materials of Japanese tradition in ways that audiences all over the world can understand\u2026 more or less.\n\nThe two best-known new wave filmmakers are Nagisa Oshima (whose \u201cIn the Realm of the Senses\u201d created an international controversy with its graphic story of a geisha and her obsessed lover) and Masahiro Shinoda, whose \u201cThe Ballad of Orin\u201d is having its Midwest premiere at the Film Center.\n\nShinoda\u2019s film is rooted in Japan, circa 1918, and tells the story of Orin, a blind girl abandoned at the age of 6 and forced to join a band of \u201cgoze,\u201d blind itinerant singers who traveled the countryside together fur mutual protection. We learn her history in interlocking flashbacks: After some years of happiness, she is banished from the group after losing her virginity and becomes frankly promiscuous.\n\nBut then she\u2019s taken under the arm of a strong protector, Heitaro, an Army deserter who is as much an outcast as she is. They travel together, are separated, find each other again by accident, survive bad times and are finally jailed and charged with murder.\n\nShinoda and the master Japanese cameraman Kazuo Miyagawa tell this story in stunning visual terms: There\u2019s an ironic contrast between the supreme beauty of many of their images and the blindness of their heroine. There are countless moments of beauty: A cart being pulled across a bridge against a backdrop of blue sky, the wind sweeping an empty field, a terrifying drop from a cliff, tiny birds being fed by a parent, and countless other images from nature.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1978, "date_published": "1980-01-10", "genres": null, "title": "The Ballad of Orin (1978)"}
