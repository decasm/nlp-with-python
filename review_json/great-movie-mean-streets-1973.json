For Catholics raised before Vatican II, it has a resonance that it may lack for other audiences. The film recalls days when there was a greater emphasis on sin--and rigid ground rules, inspiring dread of eternal suffering if a sinner died without absolution.\n\nThe key words in the movie are the first ones, spoken over a black screen: \u201cYou don\u2019t make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. All the rest is BS and you know it.\u201d The voice belongs to Scorsese. We see Charlie (Harvey Keitel) starting up in bed, awakened by a dream, and peering at his face in a bedroom mirror. The voice was Scorsese\u2019s, but it possibly represents words said to him by a priest.\n\nLater Charlie talks in a voice-over about how a priest gave him the usual \u201c10 Hail Marys and 10 Our Fathers,\u201d but he preferred a more personal penance; in the most famous shot in the film, he holds his hand in the flame of a votive candle before the altar, testing himself against the fires of hell.\n\n\u201cThe clearest fact about Charlie,\u201d Pauline Kael wrote in her influential review launching the 1973 film, \u201cis that whatever he does in his life, he\u2019s a sinner.\u201d The film uses lighting to suggest his slanted moral view. The real world is shot in ordinary colors, but then Charlie descends into the bar run by his friend Tony, and it is always bathed in red, the color of sex, blood and guilt.\n\nHe enters the bar in a series of shots at varying levels of slow-motion (a Scorsese trademark). He walks past his friends, exchanging ritual greetings, and eventually he gets up on the stage with the black stripper, and dances with her for a few bars of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. He fantasizes about the stripper (Jeannie Bell), and later in the movie even makes a date with her (but fears being seen by his friends with a black woman, and stands her up). He also dreams of his cousin Teresa (Amy Robinson), who is Johnny\u2019s sister. They have sex, but when she says she loves him, he says, \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\nFor him both women--any woman he feels lust for--represent a possible occasion of sin, which invests them with such mystery and power that sex pales by comparison. (Immediately after dancing with the stripper, he goes to the bar, lights a match and holds his finger above it--instant penance).\n\nCharlie walks through the movie seeking forgiveness--from his Uncle Giovanni (Cesare Danova), who is the local Mafia boss, and from Teresa, his best friend Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro), the local loan shark Michael (Richard Romulus) and even from God. He wants redemption. Scorsese, whose screenplay has autobiographical origins, knows why Charlie feels this way: He knows in his bones that the church is right, and he is wrong and weak. Although he is an apprentice gangster involved with men who steal, kill and sell drugs, Charlie\u2019s guilt centers on sex. Impurity is the real sin; the other stuff is business.\n\nThe film watches Charlie as he uneasily tries to reconcile his various worlds. He works as a collector for Giovanni, hearing the sad story of a restaurant owner who has no money. Charlie is being groomed to run the restaurant, but must obey Giovanni, who forbids him to associate with Johnny Boy (\u201chonorable men go with honorable men\u201d) and with Teresa, whose epilepsy is equated in Giovanni\u2019s mind with madness.\n\nTrouble is brewing because Johnny Boy owes money to Michael, who is growing increasingly unhappy about his inability to collect. De Niro plays Johnny almost as a holy fool: a smiling jokester with no sense of time or money, and a streak of self-destruction. The first time we see him in the film, he blows up a corner mailbox. Why? No reason. De Niro and Keitel have a scene in the bar\u2019s back room that displays the rapport these two actors would carry through many movies. Charlie is earnest, frightened, telling Johnny he has to pay the money. Johnny launches on a rambling, improvised cock-and-bull story about a poker game, a police raid, a fight--finally even losing the thread himself.\n\nScorsese first displayed his distinctive style in his first feature, \u201cI Call First / Who's That Knocking at My Door?,\u201d which was also set in Little Italy and also starred Keitel. In both films he uses a hand-held camera for scenes of quick movement and fights, and scores everything with period rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music (a familiar tactic now, but unheard of in 1967).\n\nThe style is displayed joyously in \u201cMean Streets\u201d as Charlie and friends go to collect from a pool hall owner, who is happy to pay. But then Johnny Boy is called a \u201cmook,\u201d and although nobody seems quite sure what a mook is, that leads to a wild, disorganized fight. These are not smooth stuntmen, slamming each other in choreographed action, but uncoordinated kids in their 20s who smoke too much, drink too much, and fight as if they don\u2019t want to get their shirts torn. The camera pursues them around the room, and Johnny Boy leaps onto a pool table, awkwardly practicing the karate kicks he\u2019s learned in 42nd Street grind houses; on the soundtrack is \u201cPlease Mr. Postman\u201d by the Marvelettes. Scorsese\u2019s timing is acute: Cops barge in to break up the fight, are paid off by the pool hall owner, leave, and then another tussle breaks out.\n\nUnderlying everything is Charlie\u2019s desperation. He loves Johnny and Teresa, but is forbidden to see them. He tries to be tough with Teresa, but lacks the heart. His tenderness toward Johnny Boy is shown in body language (hair tousling, back-slapping) and in a scene where Johnny is on the roof, \u201cshooting out the light in the Empire State Building.\u201d Charlie essentially feels bad about everything he does; his self-hatred colors every waking thought.\n\nAt one point, late in the film, he goes into the bar, orders scotch and holds his fingers over the glass as the bartender pours, copying the position of the priest\u2019s fingers over the chalice. That kind of sacramental detail would also be a motif in \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d where overhead shots mirror the priest\u2019s-eye-view of the altar, and the hero also places his hand in a flame. Everything leads, as it must, to the violent conclusion, in which Michael, the loan shark who feels insulted, drives while a gunman (Scorsese) fires in revenge. Who can be surprised that Charlie, after the shooting, is on his knees?\n\nSeen after 25 years, \u201cMean Streets\u201d is a little creaky at times; this is an early film by a director who was still learning, and who learned so fast that by 1976 he would be ready to make \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d one of the greatest films of all time, also with De Niro and Keitel. The movie doesn\u2019t have the headlong flow, the unspoken confidence in every choice, that became a Scorsese hallmark. It was made on a tiny budget with actors still finding their way, and most of it wasn\u2019t even shot on the mean streets of the title, but in disguised Los Angeles locations. But it has an elemental power, a sense of spiraling doom, that a more polished film might have lacked.\n\nAnd in the way it sees and hears its characters, who are based on the people Scorsese knew and grew up with in Little Italy, it was an astonishingly influential film. If Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Godfather\u201d fixed an image of the Mafia as a shadow government, Scorsese\u2019s \u201cMean Streets\u201d inspired the other main line in modern gangster movies, the film of everyday reality. \u201cThe Godfather\u201d was about careers. \u201cMean Streets\u201d was about jobs. In it you can find the origins of all those other films about the criminal working class, like \u201cKing of the Gypsies,\u201d \u201cGoodFellas,\u201d \u201cCity of Industry,\u201d \u201cSleepers,\u201d \u201cState of Grace,\u201d \u201cFederal Hill,\u201d \"Gridlock'd\u201d and \u201cDonnie Brasco.\u201d Great films leave their mark not only on their audiences, but on films that follow. In countless ways, right down to the detail of modern TV crime shows, \u201cMean Streets\u201d is one of the source points of modern movies.", "running_time": 110, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "2003-12-31", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "title": "Mean Streets (1973)"}
