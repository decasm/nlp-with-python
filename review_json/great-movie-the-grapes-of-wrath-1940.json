The message is\r\nboldly displayed, but told with characters of such sympathy and images of such\r\nbeauty that audiences leave the theater feeling more pity than anger or\r\nresolve. It's a message movie, but not a recruiting poster.\n\nThe ideological journey of the hero, Tom Joad, can be seen by\r\nthe two killings he is responsible for. The first one takes place in a saloon\r\nbefore the action begins, and Tom describes it to a former preacher: \"We\r\nwas drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his\r\nhead plum to squash.\" After serving four years, Tom is paroled and returns\r\nto his family farm in Oklahoma, only to learn the Joads have been\r\n\"tractored off the land\" and are joining the desperate migration to\r\nCalifornia. Near the end of the film, after seeing deputies and thugs beat and\r\nshoot at strikers, he is once again attacked, this time by a \"tin\r\nbadge\" with a club. He snatches away the club, and kills him. The lesson\r\nis clear: Tom has learned who his real enemies are, and is working now with more\r\ndeserving targets.\n\nThe\r\nmovie was based on John Steinbeck's novel, arguably the most effective social\r\ndocument of the 1930s, and it was directed by a filmmaker who had done more\r\nthan any other to document the Westward movement of American settlement. John\r\nFord was the director of \"The Iron Horse\" (1924), about the dream of\r\na railroad to the West, and made many other films about the white migration\r\ninto Indian lands, including his Cavalry trilogy (\"Fort Apache,\"\r\n\"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,\" \"Rio Grande\"). \"The Grapes\r\nof Wrath\" tells the sad end of the dream. The small shareholders who\r\nstaked their claims 50 years earlier are forced off their land by bankers and\r\nbig landholders. \"Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Company?\" asks\r\nMuley, a neighbor of the Joads who refuses to sell. \"It ain't\r\nanybody,\" says a land agent. \"It's a company.\"\n\nThe\r\nmovie finds a larger socialist lesson in this, when Tom tells Ma: \"One guy\r\nwith a million acres and a hundred thousand farmers starvin'.\" Of course\r\nTom didn't know the end of the story, about how the Okies would go to work in\r\nwar industries and their children would prosper more in California than they\r\nwould have in Oklahoma, and their grandchildren would star in Beach Boys songs.\r\nIt is easy to forget that for many, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" had a\r\nhappy, unwritten, fourth act.\n\nWhen\r\nSteinbeck published his novel in 1939, it was acclaimed as a masterpiece, won\r\nthe Pulitzer Prize, was snatched up by Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century-Fox and\r\nassigned to his top director, John Ford. It expressed the nation's rage about\r\nthe Depression in poetic, Biblical terms, and its dialogue does a delicate\r\nlittle dance around words like \"agitators\" and \"Reds\"--who\r\nare, we are intended to understand, what the fat cats call anyone who stands up\r\nfor the little man. With Hitler rising in Europe, Communism would enjoy a brief\r\nrespite from the American demonology.\n\nThe\r\nmovie won Oscars for best director and best actress (Jane Darwell as Ma Joad)\r\nand was nominated for five others, including best actor (Henry Fonda) and best\r\npicture (it lost to Hitchcock's \"Rebecca\"). In a year when there were\r\n10 best film nominees Ford had even another entry, \"The Long Voyage\r\nHome.\" \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was often named the greatest\r\nAmerican film, until it was dethroned by the re-release of \"Citizen\r\nKane\" in 1958, and in the recent American Film Institute poll it finished\r\nin the top 10. But do many people watch it anymore? It's not even on DVD.\n\nWhen\r\nthe DVD restoration does finally arrive, viewers will discover a film that uses\r\nrealistic black-and-white cinematography to temper its sentiment and provide a\r\ndocumentary quality to scenes like the entry into the Okie transient camp near\r\nthe California border. Even though the Joad farm is a studio set, Ford liked to\r\nshoot on location, and records a journey down Route 66 from the Dust Bowl\r\nthrough New Mexico and Arizona, past shabby gas stations and roadside diners.\r\nThe dialogue sometimes grows a little too preachy to fit within the simple\r\nvernacular of farmers, and Tom Joad's famous farewell to Ma (\"Wherever\r\nthere's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop\r\nbeatin' up a guy, I'll be there ...\") always sounds to me like writing,\r\nnot spontaneous expression.\n\nBut\r\nit is dialogue spoken by Henry Fonda, whose Tom Joad is one of the great\r\nAmerican movie characters, so pure and simple and simplytherein the role that he puts it over.\r\nFonda was an actor with the rare ability to exist on the screen without seeming\r\nto reach or try, and he makes it clear even in his silences how he has been\r\npondering Preacher's conversion from religion to union politics. We're not\r\nsurprised when he tells Ma, \"Maybe it's like Casy says. A fella ain't got\r\na soul of his own, just a little piece of a big soul. The one big soul that\r\nbelongs to everybody.\" Just as, in the dream of One Big Union,\r\ntranscendentalism meets Marxism.\n\nThe\r\nphotography is by the great innovator Gregg Toland, who also shot \"The\r\nLong Voyage Home\" and after those two Ford pictures and William Wyler's\r\n\"The Westerner\" moved on directly to his masterpiece, Orson Welles'\r\n\"Citizen Kane.\" In \"Voyage\" he experimented with the\r\ndeep-focus photography that would be crucial to \"Kane.\" In\r\n\"Grapes\" he worked with astonishingly low levels of light; consider\r\nthe many night scenes and the shots in the deserted Joad homestead, where Tom\r\nand the preacher seem illuminated by a single candle, Tom silhouetted, Casy\r\nside-lit.\n\nThe\r\npower of Ford (1884-1973) was rooted in strong stories, classical technique and\r\ndirect expression. Years of apprenticeship in low-budget silent films, many of\r\nthem quickies shot on location, had steeled him against unnecessary set-ups and\r\nfancy camera work. There is a rigorous purity in his visual style that serves\r\nthe subject well. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" contains not a single shot\r\nthat seems careless or routine.\n\nFonda\r\nand Jane Darwell are the actors everyone remembers, although John Carradine's\r\nCasy is also instrumental. Darwell worked in the movies for 50 years, never\r\nmore memorably than here, where she has the final word (\"We'll go on\r\nforever, Pa. 'Cause ... we're the people!\"). The novel of course ends with\r\na famous scene that stunned its readers, as Rose of Sharon, having lost her\r\nbaby, offers her milk-filled breast to a starving man in a railroad car.\r\nHollywood, which stretched itself in allowing Clark Gable to say\r\n\"damn\" a year earlier in \"Gone With the Wind,\" was not\r\nready for that scene, even by implication, in 1940. Since the original\r\naudiences would have known it was left out, the film ended with safe sentiment\r\ninstead of Steinbeck's bold melodramatic masterstroke.\n\nI\r\nwonder if American audiences will ever again be able to understand the original\r\nimpact of this material, on the page and on the screen. The centenary of\r\nSteinbeck's birth is now being observed with articles sniffing that he was not,\r\nafter all, all that good, that his Nobel was undeserved, that he was of his\r\ntime and has dated. But one would not want \"The Grapes of Wrath\"\r\nwritten differently; irony, stylistic experimentation and \"modernism\"\r\nwould weaken it.\n\nThe\r\nnovel and movie do last, I think, because they are founded in real experience\r\nand feeling. My parents were scarred by the Depression, it was a remembered\r\ndevastation I sensed in their very tones of voice, and \"The Grapes of\r\nWrath\" shows half a nation with the economic rug pulled out from under it.\r\nThe story, which seems to be about the resiliency and courage of \"the\r\npeople,\" is built on a foundation of fear: Fear of losing jobs, land,\r\nself-respect. To those who had felt that fear, who had gone hungry or been\r\nhomeless, it would never become dated. And its sense of injustice, I believe,\r\nis still relevant. The banks and land agents of the 1930s have been replaced by\r\nfinancial pyramids so huge and so chummy with the government that Enron, for\r\nexample, had to tractor itself off its own land.", "running_time": 129, "mpaa_rating": "G", "release_year": 1940, "date_published": "2002-03-31", "genres": ["Drama", "Road Movie"], "title": "The Grapes of Wrath (1940)"}
