The score was\r\nperformed on a zither by Anton Karas, who was playing in a Vienna beerhouse one\r\nnight when Reed heard him. The sound is jaunty but without joy, like whistling\r\nin the dark. It sets the tone; the action begins like an undergraduate lark and\r\nthen reveals vicious undertones.\n\nThe\r\nstory begins with a spoken prologue (\"I never knew the old Vienna, before\r\nthe war. . .\"). The shattered postwar city has been divided into French,\r\nAmerican, British and Russian zones, each with its own cadre of suspicious\r\nofficials. Into this sinkhole of intrigue falls an American innocent: Holly\r\nMartins (Joseph Cotton), alcoholic author of pulp Westerns. He has come at the\r\ninvitation of his college chum Harry Lime. But Lime is being buried when\r\nMartins arrives in Vienna.\n\nHow\r\ndid Lime die? That question is the engine that drives the plot, as Martins\r\nplunges into the murk that Lime left behind. Calloway (Trevor Howard), the\r\nBritish officer in charge, bluntly says Lime was an evil man, and advises Holly\r\nto take the next train home. But Harry had a girl named Anna (Alida Valli), who\r\nHolly sees at Lime's grave, and perhaps she has some answers. Certainly Holly\r\nhas fallen in love with her, although his trusting Yankee heart is no match for\r\nher defenses.\n\n\"The\r\nThird Man\" (1949) was made by men who knew the devastation of Europe at\r\nfirst hand. Carol Reed worked for the British Army's wartime documentary unit,\r\nand the screenplay was by Graham Greene, who not only wrote about spies but\r\noccasionally acted as one. Reed fought with David O. Selznick, his American\r\nproducer, over every detail of the movie; Selznick wanted to shoot on sets, use\r\nan upbeat score and cast Noel Coward as Harry Lime. His film would have been\r\nforgotten in a week. Reed defied convention by shooting entirely on location in\r\nVienna, where mountains of rubble stood next to gaping bomb craters, and the\r\nruins of empire supported a desperate black market economy. And he insisted on\r\nKaras' zither music (\"The Third Man Theme\" was one of 1950's biggest\r\nhits).\n\nReed\r\nand his Academy Award-winning cinematographer, Robert Krasker, also devised a\r\nreckless, unforgettable visual style. More shots, I suspect, are tilted than\r\nare held straight; they suggest a world out of joint. There are fantastic\r\noblique angles. Wide-angle lenses distort faces and locations. And the bizarre\r\nlighting makes the city into an expressionist nightmare. (During a stakeout for\r\nLime, a little balloon man wanders onto the scene, and his shadow is a monster\r\nthree stories high). Vienna in \"The Third Man\" is a more particular\r\nand unmistakable *place* than almost any other location in the history of the\r\nmovies; the action fits the city like a hand slipping on a glove.\n\nThen\r\nthere are the faces: Joseph Cotton's open, naive face contrasts with the\r\n\"friends\" of Harry Lime: the corrupt \"Baron\" Kurtz (Ernst\r\nDeutsch); the shifty Dr. Winkel (Erich Ponto), the ratlike Popescu (Siegfried\r\nBreuer). Even a little boy with a rubber ball looks like a wizened imp. The\r\nonly trusting faces are those of innocents like the hall porter (Paul\r\nHoerbiger) who tells Holly, \"There was another man . . . a third man. .\r\n.\" and the beefy Sgt. Paine (Bernard Lee), Calloway's aide, who levels the\r\ndrunken Holly with a shot to the chin and then apologizes. Even the resident\r\nexiles are corrupt; Crabbin (Wilfrid Hyde-White), the head of the discussion\r\ngroup, chatters about culture while smoothly maneuvering his mistress out of\r\nsight through doors and up stairs.\n\nAs\r\nfor Harry Lime: He allows Orson Welles to make the most famous entrance in the\r\nhistory of the movies, and one of the most famous speeches. By the time Lime\r\nfinally appears we have almost forgotten Welles is even *in* the movie. The\r\nsequence is unforgettable: the meow of the cat in the doorway, the big shoes,\r\nthe defiant challenge by Holly, the light in the window, and then the shot,\r\npushing in, on Lime's face, enigmatic and teasing, as if two college chums had\r\nbeen caught playing a naughty prank.\n\nThe\r\nfamous speech comes during an uneasy ride on a giant Ferris wheel; at one\r\npoint, Lime slides open the door of the car they are riding in, and Holly\r\nuneasily wraps an arm around a post. Harry tries to justify himself: \"You\r\nknow what the fellow said: In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had\r\nwarfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo\r\nda Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love--they had\r\n500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo\r\nclock.\" (Greene says this speech was written by Welles.)\n\nThe\r\nemotional heart of the movie is Holly's infatuation with Anna, who will love\r\nHarry and be grateful to him no matter what she learns. The scenes between\r\nHolly and Anna are enriched by tiny details, as when they visit Harry's\r\napartment and she opens a drawer without looking--because she already knows\r\nwhat will be inside. Or the way she sometimes slips and calls Holly\r\n\"Harry.\" Everyone in the movie has trouble with names. Holly calls\r\nCalloway \"Callahan,\" and Dr. Winkle insists on \"VINK-ell!\"\r\nAnd the name on Harry Lime's tombstone is wrong, too.\n\nThe\r\nchase sequence in \"The Third Man\" is another joining of the right\r\naction with the right location. Harry escapes into the sewer system like a\r\ncornered rat, and Reed edits the pursuit into long, echoing, empty sewer\r\nvistas, and closeups of Lime's sweaty face, his eyes darting for a way out.\r\nPresumably there would be no lights in the Vienna sewers, but there are strong\r\nlight sources just out of sight behind every corner, throwing elongated\r\nshadows, backlighting Harry and his pursuers.\n\nThe\r\nfinal scene in \"The Third Man\" is a long, elegiac sigh. It almost did\r\nnot exist. Selznick and Greene originally wanted a happy ending. (Greene\r\noriginally wrote, \". . . her hand was through his arm\"). Reed\r\nconvinced Greene he was wrong. The movie ends as it begins, in a cemetery, and\r\nthen Calloway gives Holly a ride back to town. They pass Anna walking on the\r\nroadside. Holly asks to be let out of the jeep. He stands under a tree, waiting\r\nfor her. She walks toward him, past him, and then out of frame, never looking.\r\nAfter a long pause, Holly lights a cigarette and wearily throws away the match.\r\nJoseph Cotten recalled later that he thought the scene would end sooner. But\r\nReed kept the camera running, making it an unusually long shot, and absolutely\r\nperfect.\n\n\"The\r\nThird Man\" reflects the optimism of Americans and the bone-weariness of\r\nEurope after the war. It's a story about grownups and children: Adults like\r\nCalloway, who has seen at first hand the results of Lime's crimes, and children\r\nlike the trusting Holly, who believes in the simplified good and evil of his\r\nWestern novels.\n\n\"The\r\nThird Man\" is like the exhausted aftermath of \"Casablanca.\" Both\r\nhave heroes who are American exiles, awash in a world of treachery and black\r\nmarket intrigue. Both heroes love a woman battered by the war. But\r\n\"Casablanca\" is bathed in the hope of victory, while \"The Third\r\nMan\" already reflects the Cold War years of paranoia, betrayal and the\r\nBomb. The hero doesn't get the girl in either movie--but in\r\n\"Casablanca,\" Ilsa stays with the resistance leader to help in his\r\nfight, while in \"The Third Man\" Anna remains loyal to a rat. Yet\r\nHarry Lime saved Anna, a displaced person who faced certain death. Holly will\r\nnever understand what Anna did to survive the war, and Anna has absolutely no\r\ndesire to tell him.\n\nOf\r\nall the movies I have seen, this one most completely embodies the romance of\r\ngoing to the movies. I saw it first on a rainy day in a tiny, smoke-filled\r\ncinema on the Left Bank in Paris. It told a story of existential loss and\r\nbetrayal. It was weary and knowing, and its glorious style was an act of\r\ndefiance against the corrupt world it pictured. Seeing it, I realized how many\r\nHollywood movies were like the pulp Westerns that Holly Martins wrote: naive\r\nformulas supplying happy endings for passive consumption. I read the other day\r\nthat they plan to remake \"The Third Man.\" Do you think Anna will cave\r\nin to Holly--or will she remain true to her bitter cynicism and unspeakable\r\nknowledge?", "running_time": 104, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 1949, "date_published": "1996-12-08", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "Film Noir", "Foreign", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "title": "The Third Man (1949)"}
