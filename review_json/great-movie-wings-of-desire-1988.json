They are witnesses, and they have been watching for a long time--since the beginning. Standing on a concrete river bank in Berlin, they recall that it took a long time before the primeval river found its bed. They remember the melting of the glaciers. They are a reflection of the solitude of God, who created everything and then had no one to witness what he had done; the role of the angels is to see. \n\nIn Wim Wenders\u2019 film, they move invisibly through the divided city of Berlin, watching, listening, comparing notes. Often they stand on high places--the shoulder of a heroic statue, the tops of buildings--but sometimes they descend to comfort an accident victim, or to put a hand on the shoulder of a young man considering suicide. They cannot directly change events (the young man does kill himself), but perhaps they can suggest the possibility of hope, the intuition that we are not completely alone.\n\nThe film evokes a mood of reverie, elegy and meditation. It doesn\u2019t rush headlong into plot, but has the patience of its angels. It suggests what it would be like to see everything but not participate in it. We follow two angels: Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander). They listen to the thoughts of an old Holocaust victim, and of parents worried about their son, and of the passengers on trams and the people in the streets; it\u2019s like turning the dial and hearing snatches of many radio programs. They make notes about the hooker who hopes to earn enough money to go south, and the circus aerialist who fears that she will fall, because it is the night of the full moon.\n\nYou\u2019re seduced into the spell of this movie, made in 1987 by Wenders, who collaborated on the screenplay with the German playwright Peter Handke. It moves slowly, but you don\u2019t grow impatient, because there is no plot to speak of, and so you don\u2019t fret that it should move to its next predictable stage. It is about being, not doing. And then it falls into the world of doing, when the angel Damiel decides that he must become human.\n\nHe falls in love with the trapeze artist. He goes night after night to the shabby little circus where she performs above the center ring. He is touched by her doubts and vulnerability. He talks with Cassiel, the other angel, about how it would feel to feel: to be able to feed a cat, or get ink from a newspaper on your fingers. He senses a certain sympathy from one of the humans he watches, an American movie actor (Peter Falk, playing himself). \u201cI can\u2019t see you, but I know you\u2019re here,\u201d Falk tells him. How can Falk sense him? Sometimes children can see angels, but adults are supposed to have lost the facility.\n\nThe answers to these questions are all made explicitly clear, in the new Hollywood movie \u201cCity of Angels,\u201d which is a remake of \u201cWings of Desire\u201d and spells out what the original film only implies. After seeing the new film, which stars Nicolas Cage as the angel and Meg Ryan as the woman (now a heart surgeon rather than an aerialist), I went back to \u201cWings of Desire\u201d again. It reminded me of the different notes that movies can strike.\n\n\u201cCity of Angels\u201d is a skillful romantic comedy and I enjoyed it, but it all stayed there on the screen, content to be what it was. \u201cWings of Desire\u201d doesn\u2019t release its tension in a smooth plot payoff. It creates a mood of sadness and isolation, of yearning, of the transience of earthly things. If the human being is the only animal that knows it lives in time, the movie is about that knowledge.\n\nIt is a beautiful film, photographed by the legendary cinematographer Henri Alekan, who made the characters float weightlessly in Cocteau\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d (the circus in the movie is named after him). When he shows the point of view of the angels, he shoots in a kind of blue-tinted monochrome. When he sees through human eyes, he shoots in color. His camera seems liberated from gravity; it floats over the city, or glides down the aisle of an airplane. It does not intrude; it observes. When the angel follows the trapeze artist into a rock club, it doesn\u2019t fall into faster cutting rhythms; it remains detached. The critic Bryant Frazer observes that Cassiel, the other angel, \u201cleans against the wall and closes his eyes, and the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting position and color as though we\u2019re watching Cassiel\u2019s very essence fragmenting before our eyes.\u201d\n\nBruno Ganz has a good face for an angel. It is an ordinary, pleasant, open face, not improbably handsome. Like a creature who has been observing since the dawn of time, he doesn\u2019t react a lot. He has seen it all. Now he wants to feel. \u201cI\u2019m taking the plunge,\u201d his angel tells the other one. He will descend into time, disease, pain and death, because at the same time he can touch, smell and be a part of things. All that he desires is summed up in the early dawn at an outdoor coffee stand when Peter Falk tells him: \u201cTo smoke, and have coffee--and if you do it together, it\u2019s fantastic. To draw, and when your hands are cold you rub them together ... \u201c\n\nThe children in the streets call Falk \u201cColumbo,\u201d and indeed Columbo, in his dirty raincoat, enters people\u2019s lives and stands around and observes and eventually asks questions. And the angels, who wear long black topcoats, do the same things, although their questions are not easily heard.\n\nWenders is an ambitious director who experiments with the ways in which a movie can be made. I didn\u2019t think his 1992 film \u201cUntil the End of the World\u201d was a success, but I admired his audacity in following two lovers in a story improvised over five months in 20 cities in seven countries on four continents. His \u201cKings of the Road\u201d (1974) was a three-hour odyssey in which two men wander the border between East and West Germany in a VW bus, sharing confessions and insights, learning that they cannot live with women and cannot live without them. It\u2019s like an intellectual, metaphysical version of Promise Keepers. His \u201cParis, Texas\u201d (1978) was a modern remake of \u201cThe Searchers,\u201d in which a loner, played by Harry Dean Stanton, tries to track down a lost girl in a landscape that seems to forbid human connections.\n\nLike many directors who make films of greater length, Wenders is not a perfectionist. He will include what a perfectionist would leave out, because of intangible reasons that are more important to him than flawlessness. Consider, for example, the first time the trapeze artist (Solveig Dommartin) encounters Peter Falk at that coffee stand. Her performance is almost giddy; she seems like an actress pleased to meet a star she\u2019s seen on TV, and the scene\u2019s reality is broken by her vocal tone and body language. They both seem to be doing an ill-prepared improvisation. That may make it a \u201cbad\u201d scene in terms of the movie\u2019s narrow purposes, but does it have a life of its own? Yes, for the same reasons it\u2019s flawed. Movies are moments of time, and that is a moment I am happy to have.\n\n\u201cWings of Desire\u201d is one of those films movie critics are accused of liking because it\u2019s esoteric and difficult. \u201cNothing happens but it takes two hours and there\u2019s a lot of complex symbolism,\u201d complains a Web-based critic named Peter van der Linden. In the fullness of time, perhaps he will return to it and see that astonishing things happen and that symbolism can only work by being apparent. For me, the film is like music or a landscape: It clears a space in my mind, and in that space I can consider questions. Some of them are asked in the film: \u201cWhy am I me and why not you? Why am I here and why not there? When did time begin and where does space end?\u201d", "running_time": 128, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1998-04-12", "genres": ["Drama", "Fantasy", "Foreign", "Romance", "Science Fiction"], "title": "Wings of Desire (1988)"}
