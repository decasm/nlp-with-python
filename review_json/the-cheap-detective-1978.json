Let me put it this way. If you loved \u201cThe Maltese Falcon\u201d and can recite all the best lines from \u201cCasablanca\u201d by heart, you'll hate \u201cThe Cheap Detective,\u201d which is basically just the year's classiest and most expensive rip-off.\n\nBut if you've never seen \u201cCasablanca\u201d and never heard of \u201cThe Maltese Falcon,\u201d you'll really hate \u201cThe Cheap Detective\u201d because you won't get the in-jokes. To someone who does not know who Peter Lorre was, for example, there must be few things in this life less amusing than a Peter Lorre imitation.\n\nWhen I call \u201cThe Cheap Detective\u201d a rip-off, what exactly do I mean? I mean that in scene after scene they really have ripped off the original Bogart classics, right down to the costumes and lighting. Louise Fletcher may not previously have been your idea of an Ingrid Bergman look-alike, but catch her here in her floppy hat, the silk kerchief around her neck and the key lights on her eyes, and you'll be amazed.\n\nAnd the nightclub scene in \u201cThe Cheap Detective,\u201d the one inspired by Rick's place in \u201cCasablanca,\u201d goes the whole way: You have Fletcher walking in with Fernando Lamas (as the Claude Rains look-alike), and Scatman Crothers at the piano (in the Dooley Wilson role), and Falk with the cigarette dangling from his mouth, and the Germans singing their anthem and the French singing their anthem.\n\nAnd you realize a curious thing, the same thing demonstrated by \u201cHigh Anxiety,\u201d the Hitchcock spoof by Mel Brooks. You can only satirize original material by somehow going beyond it, or above it, or outside of it. And if the material had its own wit and style (if, indeed, it was classic and inimitable), then what have you achieved by putting new actors through the same paces, only with Neil Simon one-liners?\n\n\u201cThe Cheap Detective\u201d has no new insights into what made Bogart original, and therefore no new ways (or any ways at all) to make his performances seem funny. Peter Falk plays Bogart (or \u201cPeckinpaugh,\u201d as it says here: Ho, ho) with the proper lisp and the right physical mannerisms, but so what? Where do we draw the line between imitation as satire, imitation as flattery and imitation as a tipoff that a movie is bankrupt of new ideas?\n\nAnd look, for another example, at John Houseman's performance as \u201cJasper Blubber,\u201d a character obviously patterned after Sydney Greenstreet. (In both \u201cCasablanca\u201d and \u201cThe Maltese Falcon,\u201d remember?) Houseman is a fine and original character actor. But he's not asked to act here, he's asked to be a mimic. Aside from minor matters of inflection and appearance, his character and dialog resemble Greenstreet's so completely that this isn't satire, it's a necrophiliac guest appearance.\n\nThe women in the picture are all supposed to be variations of Mary Astor, Ingrid Bergman and Lauren Bacall, I guess. But listen to how lamely Simon tries for his laughs. Bacall to Bogart, in \u201cTo Have and Have Not\u201d: \u201cIf you want me, just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just pucker your lips, and blow.\u201d Marsha Mason to Falk, in \u201cThe Cheap Detective\u201d: \u201cIf you want me, just telephone. You know how to telephone, don't you? Just put your finger in the little round hole.\u201d Neil Simon's reputation for wit will not survive very many more such lines.", "running_time": 92, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1978, "date_published": "1978-06-23", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "title": "The Cheap Detective (1978)"}
