He should have said, \u201cSo are the people in French farces.\u201d He\u2019s talking about the sort of family that forms every time a movie shoots, and breaks up when it wraps. For several weeks there\u2019s a kind of forced community where privacy is rare, everyone is exhausted, and emotional desperation is epidemic.\n\nTruffaut\u2019s film, made in 1973 and being revived this week at Facets with a newly-struck 35-mm. print, is a poem in praise of making movies. Not good movies, not bad movies - movies. It takes place at the Victorine Studio in Nice, in the south of France, which has produced movies since the silent days. Truffaut himself plays Ferrand, the director of a movie named \u201cMeet Pamela,\u201d which is pretty clearly going to be a stinker. Ferrand exhibits not the slightest sign that he knows this, or would care if he did; he isn\u2019t intended to be a director of ambitious movies (like Truffaut), but a technician, in love with the process - with the stunts and special effects, the chemistry between the actors, the daily shooting schedule.\n\nStrange, seeing this movie again in 1997, how much it reminded me of the recent films \u201cEd Wood\u201d and \u201cBoogie Nights.\u201d Those are both films about people for whom the end product - the film itself - is only the necessary byproduct of their real reason to be in the movie business, which is to be on the set. To be making a movie. For a certain kind of emotionally footloose, artistic personality, a movie production is like a homeless shelter: Their basic animal needs are satisfied, they are too tired to see beyond the morning call, and sex, when it comes, is between people who are careful to agree it doesn\u2019t mean too much.\n\nWhen visitors from the real world arrive (husbands, lovers, bankers, journalists), they are provided with a director\u2019s chair to sit in, and they watch the action and nod and smile like proud grandparents. They\u2019ll never understand. \u201cI\u2019d drop a guy for a film,\u201d a character says in \u201cDay for Night.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d never drop a film for a guy.\u201d\n\nTruffaut\u2019s film is like a little anthology of anecdotes from movie sets. We recognize all the familiar types: The callow young love-mad star (Jean-Pierre Leaud); the alcoholic diva past her prime (Valentina Cortese); the sexy romantic lead (Jacqueline Bisset), whose breakdowns are hopefully behind her now that she\u2019s married her doctor; and the aging leading man (Jean-Pierre Aumont) who is finally coming to terms with his homosexuality. There are also the functionaries with supporting roles: The script girl, the stunt man, the producer, the woman who runs the hotel.\n\nDuring the course of the movie romances end and begin, marriages are threatened and repaired, people lock themselves in their rooms, and a cat refuses to lap up the milk on cue. We learn in an offhand way some of the trade secrets of moviemaking, such as how they make it snow in the summertime, how a third-floor balcony can have no building beneath it, and how scenes are shot \u201cday for night\u201d (a filter is used to give the effect of night while shooting in daylight).\n\nThe movie is narrated by the Truffaut character. \u201cShooting a movie is like a stagecoach trip,\u201d he says. \u201cAt first you hope for a nice ride. Then you just hope to reach your destination.\u201d At night he has a dream, in black and white of course, in which he\u2019s a small boy going downtown after dark. He reaches through the grating in front of the local theater, and steals the 8-by-10 glossy publicity stills for \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d Earlier there\u2019s a scene where Ferrand and his producer (Jean Champion) shuffle through glossy photos of their actress (Bisset). The parallel is clear. As a youth, Ferrand dreamed of being another Welles, but now he\u2019s pleased to simply work in the same industry.\n\nIn her review of the film, Pauline Kael wrote that it was \u201ca movie for the movie-struck, the essentially naive - those who would rather see a movie, any movie (a bad one, a stupid one, or an evanescent, sweet-but-dry little wafer of a movie like this one), than do anything else.\u201d It may not be for them, but it\u2019s certainly about them. When Leaud\u2019s girlfriend says she\u2019s glad to be in Nice with all of its restaurants, he\u2019s shocked: \u201cLittle restaurants? You must be joking! Don\u2019t you know Nice has 37 movies? We can grab a sandwich.\u201d\n\nKael\u2019s review is indignant: \u201cI don\u2019t share Truffaut\u2019s fond regard for the kind of moviemaking that `Meet Pamela\u2019 represents.\u201d No, but it\u2019s possible to share Truffaut\u2019s affection for the people who make them. I asked Jeanne Moreau once about one of her famous scenes. She told me she hadn\u2019t seen any of her movies, except for a handful at film festivals, where her presence was required. \u201cI get paid to make them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get paid to see them.\u201d\n\nFrancois Truffaut (1932-1984) was one of the most beloved of filmmakers, a man whose own love of film was obvious in such details as the old-fashioned iris shots he borrowed from silent films. (That\u2019s a shot where the screen seems to screw down to circle one detail, before going to black). \u201cThe most beautiful thing I have seen in a movie theater,\u201d he once said, \u201cis to go down to the front, and turn around, and look at all the uplifted faces, the light from the screen reflected upon them.\u201d\n\nTruffaut was a founder of the New Wave generation - French film critics who celebrated Hollywood\u2019s veterans in the 1950s and then made their own films. He was there at the start, with \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d (1959), \u201cShoot the Piano Player\u201d (1960) and \u201cJules and Jim\u201d (1961, starring Moreau - I hope she saw it). In 25 years he directed 23 films. Why did he make so many? I think because he loved to be on the set. The young actor in \u201cDay for Night\u201d is heartbroken after his girl runs off with the stuntman. Truffaut\u2019s character consoles him: \u201cPeople like us are only happy in our work.\u201d", "running_time": 120, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1997-12-26", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Foreign"], "title": "Day for Night (1973)"}
