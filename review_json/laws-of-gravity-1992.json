They never shut up. You could call them criminal, but not criminals - they're not ambitious or wellenough organized to qualify for professional standing. They go into drug stores and steal shampoo, stuff like that. Then they fight over whether they stole crappy shampoo. They are in and out of a bar where they know everybody. If they read Elmore Leonard, which is doubtful, they would say, \u201cHey, he's telling our story!\u201d One day Sal turns up. He has some guns for sale. The guys buy the guns. Denise thinks this is crazy, especially since Jimmy is on parole and this is not going to look good if the guns turn up at the wrong time in the wrong way. All of this does add up to a plot, an eventually interesting one in fact, but story is not the point here. \u201cLaws of Gravity\u201d is about behavior, and its eye and ear are what make the movie worth seeing.\n\nMuch has been made of the fact that Nick Gomez, who wrote and directed this film, did it on a budget of around $35,000, in a few weeks, working with actors who saw it as a labor of love.\n\nSometimes I think stories of low-budget heroics backfire on filmmakers; the average audience would probably prefer that the movie cost more. Besides, there's always some kid like Robert Rodriguez who comes along and says his new film, \u201cEl Mariachi,\u201d cost $7,000, and then $35,000 looks like a wastrel squandering his inheritance.\n\nThe point with \u201cLaws of Gravity,\u201d no matter what it cost, is that the screenplay and the acting do such an accurate job of achieving the movie's goals. What Gomez wants to do, I guess, is to show us exactly how his characters look and sound - how they talk all the time, screaming at each other a lot, in what sometimes sounds like a movie inspired by the Rosie Perez performance in \u201cWhite Men Can't Jump.\u201d By the end of the film, we know these people fairly well, and we can understand with an almost ruthless clarity how sometimes people get themselves shot outside of taverns.", "running_time": 100, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1992, "date_published": "1992-10-02", "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "Indie"], "title": "Laws of Gravity (1992)"}
