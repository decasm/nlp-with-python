Her husband has been hit by a motorcycle and is laid off with a broken leg. Her brother-in-law spies on her and her mother-inlaw spits on her. She\u2019s been diagnosed as a tuberculosis victim and sent to a sanitorium in the mountains, courtesy of the National Health Service. And now she has met a young man who is desperately in love with her, and she finds she loves him too. \u201cWe must try to keep our heads,\u201d she tells him, clinging to him. And then after a pause: \u201cBut WHY must we try to keep our heads?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the question asked and never answered in Vittorio De Sica\u2019s last film, \u201cA Brief Vacation.\u201d De Sica, who died earlier this year, was one of the great directors of the postwar Italian neorealist movement, which represented a large, loud break with Hollywood tradition and dealt with life as it might exist outside sound stages.\n\nIn movies like \u201cShoeshine\u201d and \u201cBicycle Thief\u201d he told the stories of poor people trying to survive in a system geared up to manhandle them. His films grew slicker and more commercial by the 1960s, but he never lost his gift or his heart, and there were masterpieces like \u201cThe Garden of the Finzi-Continis\u201d (1972) and now this final return to a working-class subject.\n\nIt\u2019s not a movie, though, that offers solutions to the problems it sees; de Sica\u2019s communism was outworn long ago. It\u2019s a love story, a very brief and poignant one, surrounded by a lot of anger. And it\u2019s a \u201cwoman\u2019s picture\u201d of the new sort, the kind in which women make up their own minds and make their own mistakes. His heroine, Clara (a luminous performance by Florinda Bolkan), is harassed and bone-tired and driven to shouting things like \u201cI\u2019d do better as a whore\u201d while she faces the bathroom mirror at dawn. But she has resources she never dreamed she owned.\n\nDe Sica quotes Appollinaire: \u201cSickness is the vacation of the poor.\u201d That\u2019s the case here, and as the doctor tells Clara of the spot on her lung and prescribes a month or two in the mountains, the faces of her family shrink into meanness and envy. There is the thought, never quite spoken aloud, that her duty as a wife and mother is to stay in Milan and die. But she packs and goes. \u201cNot for myself, she tells her husband in the middle of the night, \u201cbut to protect the children.\u201d\n\nWe realize within the first half hour that Clara is an intelligent woman living a life that makes few demands on intelligence. On the train she meets others going to the sanitorium, and they\u2019re all better off than she -- a rich man\u2019s mistress, a \u201cperformer\u201d -- but almost from the moment they meet her they identify with her strength. She has coped with conditions of life the rest of them can hardly imagine, and they have left her shy in this new company, but her friends respond to her resiliency and her character.\n\nThe sanitorium is like a holiday. People like her and the food is good. When she meets the young man, it is for the second time; on the day she collapsed at work she met him at the clinic. They went next door for a coffee and discussed their jobs. His was a good one at Olivetti, but he had to bend over all the time. She was seen in the cafe and her husband was informed. When she returned home, tired and sick, he slapped her. \u201cOur love began with my husband\u2019s slap,\u201d she tells the young man.\n\nTheir affair lasts only a moment. On Wednesdays the patients are allowed to go into town. They have talked once or twice, and now they come into each other\u2019s arms and make love urgently and immediately. Then they talk and dance and he asks her to run away with him to Germany. To get a divorce. \u201cThe poor cannot afford a divorce,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd what of my children? Shall I throw them out?\u201d\n\nThe love affair, her brief vacation, causes big changes in her ideas about herself. The other women tell her she\u2019s really pretty, that she should do something about her nails and learn to walk differently. She was always beautiful and now she allows herself to seem so. And her mind wakes up. A few paperbacks had been left behind by a former patient and she reads them. \u201cWho\u2019s reading this?\u201d her husband asks during a visit. He is the kind of man who puts on his jacket as if he were lifting weights. \u201cI am,\u201d she says. \u201cYou learned to read?\u201d \u201cI remembered. It was slow at first but now it goes all right.\u201d\n\nThis is a woman who tells her husband it will take the police to get her back to Milan, but at the movie\u2019s end we\u2019re not told what she will finally do. We have a notion. though. and we\u2019ve met a tough, beautiful person. For the screenplay of \u201cA Brief Vacation,\u201d de Sica returned to his old collaborator Cesare Zavattini, the man who wrote \u201cBicycle Thief\u201d and \u201cShoeshine.\u201d It\u2019s as if, at 73, he wanted to touch base again in case this was going to be his last film.", "running_time": 112, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1975-01-01", "genres": ["Drama", "Foreign"], "title": "A Brief Vacation (1973)"}
