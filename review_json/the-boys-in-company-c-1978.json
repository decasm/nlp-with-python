Only one feature was actually released during the war -- John Wayne\u2019s hawkish \u201cThe Green Berets\u201d (and how long ago it seems when \u201chawks\u201d and \u201cdoves\u201d were emotionally charged words). Three movies about returned Vietnam vets have been released, or will be soon: \u201cHeroes,\u201d \u201cRolling Thunder\u201d and \u201cComing Home.\u201d\n\nBut Sidney J. Furie\u2019s \u201cThe Boys In Company C\u201d is the first movie since 1968 about actual combat in Vietnam (Francis Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d will be the second, if it ever completes its interminable post-production). Furie\u2019s movie is, in other words, a \u201cwar movie,\u201d a member of a genre that seemed more brave and thrilling in the days of World War II and Korea, when John Wayne was storming up hills.\n\nAnd it\u2019s being attacked on just those grounds: The newsweeklies charge that it takes the old Hollywood clich\u00e9s arid simply transplants them to Southeast Asia. I don't agree. I think the movie is, first and best, a thrilling entertainment that starts by being funny and ends by being very deeply moving. But I also think it reflects an attitude about Vietnam that wouldn\u2019t have been possible in a war movie of the early 1940s.\n\nVietnam just wasn\u2019t like other wars, and you can sense that in the movie\u2019s first scenes, as a company of Marine recruits awkwardly tries to find its way through boot camp. If there\u2019s an esprit de corps here, it\u2019s one the Marines have to find by themselves, and on their own. The hard-as-nails, tough-talking drill instructors (cast, by the way, from real life) don\u2019t mention duty or patriotism much, but there\u2019s a lot of talk about how these guys had better learn to save their asses or they\u2019ll come back in body bags. The Marines are seen as a pragmatic instrument to send trained infantry to where they\u2019re needed; you don\u2019t hear anyone singing \u201cFrom the Halls of Montezuma.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this subtle but definite change in attitude that makes \u201cThe Boys In Company C\u201d more than just exciting, or entertaining. There aren\u2019t many abstract speeches in the movie, and nobody gets up and delivers his opinion about Vietnam (except in terms of the most direct cynicism). And yet, in the craziness of the company\u2019s first overseas patrol (they get caught in an enemy ambush while transporting luxury goods for a general\u2019s birthday party), all of the reality is there. And when, driven by insane demands for larger enemy body counts, they call in firepower on a nonexistent enemy position, their action seems, strangely, almost logical.\n\nThe movie bears comparison to \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d and \u201cMASH,\u201d especially in the way it constructs an easy camaraderie among its actors. The mostly young, mostly unknown cast of \u201cCompany C\u201d lived together on location in the Philippines while making the movie, and their mutual friendship seems to show through. That\u2019s especially true in the case of Chicago native Stan Shaw, who plays the Los Angeles ghetto kid who goes over to \u2018Nam planning to ship back drugs in body bags -- and winds up as the group\u2019s natural leader and unifying force. His performance is remarkably strong, and not least when he shows tenderness.\n\nThere are also good performances by James Canning, as the kid who keeps a notebook in which he writes: \u201cI\u2019d put down everything that happened today, except that nobody would believe it.\u201d And by Andrew Stevens, whose soccer game is good enough that maybe the company\u2019s team can get them all transferred out of combat. And, especially, by a former Marine D.I. named Lee Ermey, who originally signed on as a technical advisor and was so convincing he was cast in the film. One of his confrontations with Shaw provides a high point of the movie.\n\nSidney Furie, the director, hasn\u2019t had a substantial hit since \u201cLady Sings the Blues\u201d (I was not one of the admirers of his \u201cGable and Lombard\u201d). But he retains the ability to make a picture move, grow on us and involve us. That\u2019s what happens during \u201cThe Boys in Company C.\u201d", "running_time": 125, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1978, "date_published": "1978-02-24", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "title": "The Boys in Company C (1978)"}
