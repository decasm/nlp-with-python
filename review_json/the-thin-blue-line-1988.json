It was only after I met David Harris that I began to suspect that the wrong man had been convicted of murder.\u201d Although \u201cThe Thin Blue Line\u201d assembles an almost inassailable case for Adams and against Harris, it is not a conventional documentary - not a feature-length version of one of those \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segments in which innocent men are rescued from Death Row.\n\nAlthough he makes documentaries, Morris is much more interested in the spaces between the facts than with the facts themselves. He is fascinated by strange people, by odd word choices and manners of speech, by the way that certain symbols or beliefs can become fetishes with the power to rule human lives.\n\nMorris\u2019 first film was \u201cGates of Heaven\u201d (1978), which I believe is one of the greatest films ever made. Ostensibly a documentary about two pet cemeteries in Northern California and the people who owned them, it is in fact one of the most profound, and funniest, films ever made about such subjects as life and death, success and failure, dreams and disappointments, and the role that pets play in our loneliness. Although \u201cGates of Heaven\u201d has never failed to fascinate the approximately 50 audiences I have seen it with, it has never reached large numbers of people because of its subject matter; people think they don\u2019t want to see a movie about pet cemeteries, and only enthusiastic word-of-mouth has kept the movie alive (it is only recently available on home video).\n\nMorris\u2019 next film, about the strange and wonderful people who can be found in and around a small southern town, was called \u201cVernon, Florida.\u201d It played on PBS in 1981. In the years since, although he has worked on several projects, there has been no new Morris film until \u201cThe Thin Blue Line.\u201d For a time in the early 1980s, he supported himself as a private detective. Then the case of Adams began to obsess him, and the result is a film that takes its viewers back to the events on the night when Wood was shot dead.\n\nMorris has assembled many of the key witnesses in the case, including Adams, who seems passive and defeated about the fate that deposited him in a life sentence for murder, and Harris, who talks wonderingly about the fact that a person\u2019s whole life can be changed because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\n\u201cIs Randall Adams an innocent man?\u201d Morris asks Harris.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he is.\u201d \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019m the one that knows.\u201d Morris\u2019 visual style in \u201cThe Thin Blue Line\u201d is unlike any conventional documentary approach. Although his interviews are shot straight on, head and shoulders, there is a way his camera has of framing his subjects so that we look at them very carefully, learning as much by what we see as by what we hear.\n\nIn addition to the interviews, Morris uses staged reconstructions of the murder of Wood - the car without headlights, the pursuit by the police vehicle, the approach of Wood, the behavior of his fellow officer, even the lazy slow-motion whirl of a drive-in milkshake that flies through the air and falls to earth soon after Wood\u2019s bullet-ridden body.\n\nMorris also uses other kinds of images. There are scenes from \u201cSwinging Cheerleaders,\u201d the film that Adams and Harris saw together in a drive-in before the murder. (Harris said they saw the last show.\n\nMorris has discovered there was no late show on the night in question.) There are also closeups of physical evidence, of places, of clocks visualizing the impossible chronology of some of the testimony. We see family photographs that reconstruct moments in Harris\u2019 troubled childhood. We see guns, empty streets, newspaper headlines, all-night food stores.\n\nThe use of this footage is repetitive and rhythmic, and underlined by the cold, frightening original music score by Philip Glass. The result is a movie that is documentary and drama, investigation and reverie, a meditation on the fact that Adams was plucked from the center of his life and locked up forever for a crime that no reasonable person could seriously believe he committed.", "running_time": 101, "mpaa_rating": "NR", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-09-16", "genres": ["Documentary"], "title": "The Thin Blue Line (1988)"}
