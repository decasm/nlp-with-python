Little did we know back in 1968 what \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d was about to wreak.\n\nThe supernatural movie everybody is waiting for, of course, is William Friedkin\u2019s \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d due later this year as soon as Ken Nordine (who\u2019s doing the sound track) can decide how Satan giggles. In the meantime, there\u2019s Sidney Lumet\u2019s \u201cChild\u2019s Play,\u201d a well-acted movie about possession (or something) in a Catholic boy\u2019s boarding school, The place is steeped in tradition and relics, especially relics like James Mason, who has been teaching Latin 11-B for the last 30 years. He\u2019s in charge of the senior class, and every student in it loathes him. Robert Preston teaches the juniors, on the other hand, and is universally beloved, As the movie opens, Beau Bridges has just signed on as the new gym teacher. Then all hell breaks loose (to coin a phrase).\n\nThere are strange noises. Mutilated religious pictures are thrown against locked doors. Spontaneous lights break out among the students. One student is blinded, and another is hung in the school chapel (not by the neck, fortunately). Mason, who is paranoid, accuses Preston of trying to drive him out with cruel tricks like obscene telephone calls and anonymous pornographic magazines in his mailbox. And then ... well, then things get a little confusing. One of the key elements in a supernatural tale has to be a certain level of pseudo-scientific detail. We may know in our hearts that none of this stuff is possible, but the characters in the story have got to believe it. Otherwise, where\u2019s the fun? \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d had all that stuff about the black mass, and \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d was a masterpiece of detailed research.\n\nThe best supernatural novel I\u2019ve read recently hasn\u2019t received the publicity of the others, but is absolutely loaded with technical jargon and convincing little touches. It\u2019s \u201cHell House,\u201d by Richard Matheson, whose great vampire novel \u201cI Am Legend\u201d became the Charlton Heston movie \u201cThe Omega Man.\u201d\n\nMatheson gives us a scientist who believes all supernatural activities are simply a material expression of latent real energy. He invents a machine that\u2019s supposed to drain psychic energy out of haunted houses just like a lightning rod. It\u2019s all ridiculous, of course, but not when you\u2019re in the middle of the last chapter and the needle on the machine inexplicably begins to move by itself.\n\nBut back to our subject. \u201cChild\u2019s Play,\u201d which is beautifully acted and very nicely directed, doesn\u2019t seem to know whether it\u2019s really about the supernatural or not. The direction is by Sidney Lumet who keeps his camera almost entirely indoors and his confrontations in gloomy underlit alcoves and creepy shadows.\n\nThat works, but then the end comes, and we\u2019re confused. I\u2019m still not certain exactly what was going on in that school. Was Preston really sending Mason the dirty magazines, or did Bridges only think so? Were the students possessed by the devil, or merely hypnotized? Is there a Freudian hint of latent homosexuality drifting around somewhere, or is Preston merely too proud of his teaching?\n\nThe one thing I can tell you for sure - without giving away the ending - is that possession by the devil is apparently not what\u2019s wrong with the kids. Yet the entire movie is set up to suggests supernatural overtones, so when we get a rather conventional Freudian, ending, we\u2019re disappointed. The original fault lies with Robert Marasco\u2019s Broadway play, I suppose. But it could have been fixed for the movie. \u201cChild\u2019s Play\u201d seems to be about one thing and is actually about another, and that\u2019s cheating.", "running_time": 87, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-05-15", "genres": ["Comedy", "Horror"], "title": "Child's Play (1973)"}
