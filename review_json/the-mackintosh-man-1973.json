But it isn\u2019t anti in the same spirit. \u201cThe Wild Bunch\u201d grew out of an appreciation of the history of Westerns, and \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d grew out of a keen sense of the role gangster movies played in the events and fantasies of the 1930s. But \u201cThe Macintosh Man\u201d seems to have been made by a group of people with no sympathy or understanding for spy movies.\n\nThere are basically two kinds of spy movies. The first gives us a committed spy working against great odds (\u201cNotorious\u201d), and the second gives us the cynical spy who realizes that ideology is dead and spying is after all only a professional exercise (\u201cThe Ipcress File,\u201d in some ways). The funny thing about \u201cThe Mackintosh Man\u201d is that its central character doesn\u2019t seem to be either kind of spy; as played by Paul Newman, he isn\u2019t fish nor fowl, and may even be vegetable or mineral. Newman plays an agent of British counterintelligence, I guess. Guesswork is necessary because the screenplay is almost criminally messy and leaves us with more questions than it resolves. By reading between the scenes and making, a few wild surmises, I\u2019ve been able to come up with a plausible scenario in which Newman\u2019s job is to catch a counterspy played by James Mason. And he has the help of Dominique Sanda and Harry Andrews, who are daughter and father (perhaps) and are either counterintelligence themselves, or are jewel thieves. The movie is irritating in its refusal to make things clear; if spy movies are going to work like clockwork, they have to be put together with some care. Huston\u2019s sloppiness here is in direct contrast to the craftsmanship of another veteran, Fred Zinnemann, in the recent \u201cThe Day of the Jackal.\u201d If the characters aren\u2019t interesting and the story doesn\u2019t make sense (and the car chase is only average), what the movie finally becomes is a rip-off. It\u2019s discouraging, in a way, to go to a movie expecting to settle for mere entertainment and be robbed even of that.\n\nThe movie cheats us in another way, too. I was discussing it the other day with Carol White (a local free-lance movie critic who will be reviewing for The Sun-Times while I\u2019m on vacation) and she said, you know what? At least Huston could have given us a little romance. To put Paul Newman and Dominique Sanda in the same movie and not even hardly let them kiss is, shall we say, frustrating. Particularly in a movie where almost nothing else happens either.", "running_time": 98, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1973, "date_published": "1973-08-15", "genres": ["Action", "Thriller"], "title": "The Mackintosh Man (1973)"}
