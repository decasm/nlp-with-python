It is also probably his most personal, revealing film. He plays an old clown, Calvero, who was once hailed on the stages of the world as the greatest clown alive. But now Calvero has been forgotten, his art is considered \u201cobsolete,\u201d and he lives by himself in a run-down rooming house. He goes on a toot occasionally to break the monotony. Otherwise, there is nothing but his old scrapbooks and his daydreams.\n\nAs symbolical characters go, Calvero stands in pretty well for the Chaplin of 1952 (aside from the fact, of course, that Charlie was worth several dozen million dollars). Chaplin\u2019s previous film, \u201cMonsieur Verdoux\u201d (1947), had not been received well -- and represented, indeed, his first critical failure. His personal life bad been plagued by lawsuits and witch hunts, and it is sad to say that when \u201cLimelight\u201d opened in American theaters is was actually picketed by those who thought Chaplin was a Communist, or at least some sneaky kind of pinko.\n\nHe never had anything to do with any political party, of course, and in its own way \u201cLimelight\u201d considers what must have really been on Chaplin\u2019s mind in 1952. He had been, at one time not so many years before, the world\u2019s most popular entertainer. It was said that the Little Tramp was the most familiar character ever invented. But now all that was behind him.\n\nWhat comes through most clearly in \u201cLimelight,\u201d however, is that Chaplin had come to terms with his life. The character he plays doesn\u2019t miss the limelight, not really, and he had not become bitter just because of his recent hard times. He saves a young ballet dancer (Claire Bloom) from suicide and nurses her back to a stage career with his own unshakable optimism. His religion is the stage, but he doesn\u2019t need an audience in order to practice it (and some of the film\u2019s best scenes are his daydreams of stage performances that never were, or maybe never will be).\n\nLike several of Chaplin\u2019s later films, \u201cLimelight\u201d has stretches of sentimentality. I don\u2019t hold that against it; when the clown Calvero suffers a heart attack during his final performance, and then asks to be carried onstage in a drum to take his bow anyway, sentimentality is at work, yes, but a kind of sentimentality that grows out of the hammy, sincere character Chaplin has created.\n\nIf \u201cLimelight\u201d as a whole is Chaplin\u2019s farewell, then that final vaudeville act is surely his farewell to slapstick. It is a perfect, hilarious gem; he teams up with Buster Keaton to do a piano-violin duet that runs into small problems like a smashed violin and an overstrung piano. His final exit -- and then his last request to have his couch carried to the wings, so that he can watch Miss Bloom dance -- is perhaps not so much sentimentality as an expression of his belief that if all things must end, then at least they should end gracefully.\n\nNOTE: \u201cLimelight,\u201d like all of Chaplin\u2019s earlier films, was originally shot in the screen ratio of 4 to 3 (which is to say that the picture was 1.33 feet wide for every foot of height). This classic ratio, the so-called \u201cGolden Frame,\u201d has been replaced since the mid-1950s with various ratios in which the screen is wider in relation to height.\n\nSince every shot was conceived with the 4 to 3 ratio in mind, any other projection ratio would, of course, undermine the director\u2019s original intentions and his sense of visual composition and balance. Occasionally such films as \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d have been \u201cadapted\u201d to a wider screen ratio, with unhappy results. I am very happy to report that for the engagement of \u201cLimelight,\u201d the Carnegie has obtained and is using the correct equipment to project the \u201cGolden Frame.\u201d I\u2019m told the Carnegie is the only theater in the country -- including New York -- showing the Chaplin festival in the proper screen ratio.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1952, "date_published": "1972-04-19", "genres": null, "title": "Limelight (1952)"}
