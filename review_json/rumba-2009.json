{"url": "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rumba-2009", "by": "Dominique Abelas Dom", "star_rating": 2.5, "text": "\"Rumba\" is a peculiar deadpan comedy from Belgium, sort of sweet, sort of macabre, about a couple who are out of step with life but not with each other. It\u2019s not terrifically funny, but then how could it be? The influence of Jacques Tati abides in the material, without his sunniness.\n\nDom and Fiona (Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, who also co-wrote and co-directed the film with Bruno Romy) are schoolteachers and competitive rumba dancers \u2014 and dangerously out to lunch. Arriving at a dance contest, they realize they\u2019ve forgotten their costumes, race home to get them, and drive back at top speed while changing their clothes, Dom at one point upside down in the driver\u2019s seat while Fiona tugs at his socks. It\u2019s one time you\u2019re relieved to be able to see it\u2019s back projection.\n\nTheir luck worsens. Just for starters, they\u2019re in a car crash on their way home, and Dom loses his memory and Fiona her leg. This doesn\u2019t much depress them; they\u2019re loving and ebullient, and have each other. But then one catastrophe after another besets them, only one of which I will reveal.\n\nAbel and Gordon, I learn, have long worked together in cabaret, tilting toward physical comedy. They\u2019re essentially silent comedians with no need of a movie with a soundtrack, and \u201cRumba\u201d has a bare minimum of dialogue.\n\nThey\u2019re skilled. A scene when Dom tries to rescue Fiona after a mishap with a trash fire reminded me of that Buster Keaton bit where he tries to help a drunken woman into her bed.\n\nThe movie is pleasing and amusing. I think it\u2019s intended to be funnier, but it\u2019s too laid back to achieve take off. Yes, laid back, even after they burn the house down. Those damned wooden legs.
