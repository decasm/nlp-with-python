This is the stuff of nightmares. He has lived blamelessly, but a combination of circumstances have conspired to make him look blatantly guilty. And nobody can see more clearly how guilty he seems, than the innocent man himself.\n\nIn \u201cYear of the Gun,\u201d his name is David Raybourne, played by Andrew McCarthy. It is 1978, and Raybourne is an American free-lance writer, living in Rome, writing a novel. It is the time of the Red Brigades, of underground terrorist groups with fierce and unbending codes to enforce their secrecy. It is also the time of extraordinary police tactics to combat them - including secret assassination squads.\n\nRaybourne is a typical innocent American, uninvolved, living in what looks like a dream world to the European practitioners of realpolitik. Danger is all around him, but it can\u2019t touch him; after all, he\u2019s an American citizen - here\u2019s his passport. Raybourne begins writing a thriller based on a Red Brigade plot to kidnap a major Italian political leader. What he does not know is that the real Red Brigade is preparing to kidnap the famous politician Aldo Mori. If his novel were to fall into the wrong hands, it would look very much as if he had inside information. He must have been talking to someone.\n\nFrankenheimer\u2019s Rome is off-season, not filled with lots of tourists, looking wet and gray. Raybourne is living the life of an exile in a rented room. He meets some people, including Alison King (Sharon Stone), a free-lance photographer with a reputation for being in dangerous places at the right time. She\u2019s sold a lot of high-profile pictures. He also meets a Roman woman (Valeria Golino), and falls in love.\n\nAmong the characters in his exile\u2019s world are the editors and journalists of Rome\u2019s English-language daily newspaper, who are essentially outsiders like himself. Maybe some of them have connections it would be best not to examine too deeply. Then there are other people, apparently strangers, who swim into his view and seem to take an interest in him. Raybourne is such an innocent that it never occurs to him he could seriously be suspected of anything by anybody - certainly not of anything important. He is almost bemused by his own insignificance.\n\nThe novel falls into the wrong hands and is read by the wrong eyes. It appears to one side that Raybourne must be involved with the Red Brigades, and to the other that he may be prepared to betray them. Everything leads to a chilling scene in a hilltop outside of town, at which Raybourne discovers that ordinary innocent visiting Americans might indeed get shot dead for their naivete, and that just because someone likes you doesn\u2019t mean they can help you.\n\nFrankenheimer\u2019s palette is perfectly suited to this material. The grays and browns of his autumn Rome, and the wet skies above it, cast a kind of weary le Carreian gloom over the landscape.\n\nAndrew McCarthy, an open-faced, clean-cut actor, is a good choice for the lead; he looks like an innocent abroad. One of the things Frankenheimer is able to do is place this character in Rome and bury him in it, instead of simply using the city for location backdrops.\n\nThere is a long foot-chase of a kind we have seen before, but Frankenheimer makes it fresh by using architectural and street details as elements of the chase; it\u2019s like one of those chases in \u201cThe Third Man\u201d that seem to be defined by the cityscape.\n\nWill the Italian politics in \u201cYear of the Gun\u201d interest American audiences? In recent years moviegoers have seemed to develop a stubborn indifference to thriller plots that make them think. They prefer action and special effects. Frankenheimer\u2019s approach to this dilemma is to make Raybourne as much of an outsider as anyone in the audience. He\u2019s just a guy trying to make a buck writing a book. Too bad it\u2019s the wrong book.", "running_time": 111, "mpaa_rating": "R", "release_year": 1991, "date_published": "1991-11-01", "genres": ["Drama", "Mystery", "Suspense", "Thriller"], "title": "Year of the Gun (1991)"}
