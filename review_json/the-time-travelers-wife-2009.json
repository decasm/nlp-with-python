Henry is a time-traveler, and his trips are out of his control. Another problem is that whenever he arrives at another time, or even returns to the present (whenever that may be for him) he is naked. Well, that makes sense. You wouldn\u2019t expect his clothes to travel.\n\nThe dilemma of Henry (Eric Bana) and Clare (Rachel McAdams) becomes, in \u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife,\u201d a bittersweet love story. The warmth of the actors makes it surprisingly tender, considering the premise that is blatantly absurd. If you allow yourself to think for one moment of the paradoxes, contradictions and logical difficulties involved, you will be lost. The movie supports no objective thought.\n\nSo, OK. It\u2019s preposterous. Lots of movies are. What we\u2019re given is a lifelong love story that begins when a little girl (Brooklynn Proulx) gives her blanket to a naked man who has appeared in the shrubbery of her family\u2019s idyllic meadow. He tells her his name, that he\u2019s her friend and that they\u2019ll see each other again. And so they do. When she\u2019s grown, she encounters him in a library and introduces herself, because at this point in his life he doesn\u2019t know who she is. I know what you\u2019re asking yourself. Don\u2019t even go there.\n\nThey fall in love. They get married. Their wedding ceremony is threatened with disaster when he evaporates with minutes to go, but Henry is a stand-up guy and materializes from the future just in the nick of time to stand in for himself. His disappearances strike instantly, for example while he\u2019s carrying the dishes to their dinner table, Clare finds herself cleaning up a lot of spills. Although she gets pregnant, if he ever disappears during sex, we don\u2019t see it. From a strictly logical point of view, that would be the opposite of ejaculatio praecox.\n\nHenry consults Dr. Kendrick (Stephen Tobolowsky), a genetics expert, who finds he has a genetic condition named Chrono-Impairment. Apparently since this trait is in all of his genes, they travel in time simultaneously, which is just as well, lest he be scattered hither and yon. One thing\u2019s for sure: It\u2019s hard to explain how a gene for time travel could develop in the Darwinian model, since it\u2019s hard to see how an organism could ever find out that was an advantage.\n\nYou have to hand it to director Robert Schwentke and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin (\u201cGhost\u201d). They deal with these difficulties by not dealing with them at all. McAdams and Bana play their roles straight and seriously, have a pleasant chemistry, and sort of involved me in spite if myself. They\u2019re just so ... nice. She does get around to asking a logical question: Why did he appear in the first place to that little girl in the meadow, and set all of this in motion? Well, maybe he did for the simple reason that he already had, if you see what I mean.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable is how upbeat and romantic he\u2019s able to remain, considering the difficulties of always rematerializing naked. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be worn down and demoralized. I guess he has some control over where that happens, as in the meadow. But in a crucial opening scene with himself as a child, how does he find two blankets by the side of a road?\n\nHe turns up regularly in Chicago \u2014 on bridges, on elevated platforms, in alleys \u2014 and always breaks and enters to grab clothes, or steals wallets (if a naked man asks you for your wallet, what do you do?). He keeps getting arrested, and disappearing from the backs of police cars. The cops should put out a bulletin with an artists\u2019s rendition of his face: \u201cIf you catch this guy, don\u2019t arrest him. It\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d", "running_time": 107, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 2009, "date_published": "2009-08-12", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Science Fiction"], "title": "The Time Traveler's Wife (2009)"}
