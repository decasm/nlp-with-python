(1988)", "text": "Here we have it, the third entry in this season\u2019s body-exchange sweepstakes. \u201c18 Again!\u201d begins with the same premise as \u201cLike Father Like Son\u201d and \u201cVice Versa,\u201d and despite the considerable presence of George Burns, it finishes in a tie for last. It\u2019s an annual cliche at Oscar time that the competition would mean more if the actors had all played the same roles. In the case of these three movies, the race isn\u2019t close: \u201cVice Versa\u201d wins, and the other two trip over the starting line.\n\nBut why, you may ask, am I using so many metaphors from the world of footraces? That\u2019s because \u201c18 Again!\u201d cross-fertilizes two durable genres. Not only do we have an old man and his grandson trading minds and bodies, but we also have one of the most durable endings in the movies, the Big Race.\n\n\u201c18 Again!\u201d even includes a cliche so old I thought it had been retired: the moment when the hero stumbles, falls, picks himself up and keeps right on running. Does he win the race? Are there stars in the sky? \u201cVice Versa\u201d and \u201cLike Father Like Son\u201d were about a father and son trading places. In recognition of Burns\u2019s age, \u201c18 Again!\u201d has him trading places with a grandson. Tony Roberts plays the generation in between. The story: Burns is the legendary founder of the family firm, which Roberts now runs. Father and son don\u2019t communicate well, maybe because Burns never takes his son\u2019s ideas seriously. But he does have a great love for his grandson.\n\nAt Burns\u2019s 81st birthday party, he closes his eyes and makes a wish. He\u2019d like to be 18 again, with all the power and energy he remembers. He opens his eyes and his wish somehow has been granted: He inhabits his grandson\u2019s body, and the grandson (Charlie Schlatter) inhabits his.\n\nThe kid is on the high school track team, where he\u2019s kind of a nerd; he doesn\u2019t have his grandfather\u2019s never-say-die spirit. But with Burns inside the teenage body, the kid turns into a champion, and that leads up to the big race and all of its preordained suspense.\n\nThe movie also contains other developments that are less than surprises. There is, for example, the fact that the body switch also means a girlfriend switch. Anita Morris plays Burns\u2019s mistress, who can\u2019t understand what\u2019s gotten into him, so to speak. And Jennifer Runyon is the girl that the grandson loves from afar; she appreciates the most direct approach that Burns employs, once he\u2019s given the proper body to work with. There is hardly a line of dialogue involving either of these characters that is witty, or original, or comes as a surprise.\n\nThe whole project seems to have been enveloped in a miasma of good intentions and heartwarming sentiments. There\u2019s no edge, no bite and none of the inspired body language that made \u201cVice Versa\u201d so special.\n\nThe movie makes no attempt to really imagine what it would be like to inhabit another body; it just springs the gimmick on us and starts unreeling its sitcom plot.\n\nAlthough Burns is, of course, a beloved institution, and any opportunity to see him is welcome, he is not given much to do in the movie, and he doesn\u2019t do much with it. His character essentially is recycled from his old material and his patented talk-show gags, We hear him sing his 1980 hit, \u201cI Wish I Were 18 Again!,\u201d of course, and that is fun, but we also have to hear him recite that tired old line about how he would date women his age, if there were women his age. No real effort has been made to find any differences between Burns and the character he plays in this movie.\n\nBurns began the current stage of his long career in 1977, when he was recruited for the lead in \u201cOh, God!\u201d Convinced he never could play the part, he asked the producers what God was like, and was told: \u201cHe\u2019s a lot like George Burns.\u201d The problem is, Burns, God love him, has been getting that answer too often.", "star_rating": 1.5, "date_published": "1988-04-08", "release_year": 1988, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "genres": ["Comedy", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction"]}
